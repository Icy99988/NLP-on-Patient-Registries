The temporal lobe MRI signal and clinical presentation have parallels to the seem-",0
"ingly distinct disease, limbic encephalitis. Case report. A 22-year-old man with MS ingested 30 10-mg tablets of 4-AP. He had agitated behavior but was oriented, conversant, and without focal neurologic deficits or muscle fibrillations. He had cool, flushed, diaphoretic skin with temperature of 38.9°C. Blood pressure was 209/108 mm Hg, with runs of supraventricular tachycardia to 170 beats per minute. Intubation for airway protection led to intensive care unit admission.",0
"EEG exhibited frequent diffuse polyspike and spike-wave discharges that normalized over time. There were no electrographic or clinical seizures. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed diffuse hypokinesis, and an ejection fraction of 24%. CSF fluid on admission and 4 days after overdose had normal cell count, protein, and glucose, but contained CSF oligoclonal bands. Bilateral medial temporal lobe MRI hyperintensity (figure) on T2 and fluidattenuated inversion recovery did not enhance with gadolinium. His MRI before overdose did not show these signal abnormalities.",0
"Five days after overdose, he was awake with spontaneous eye opening, but had minimal awareness of the examiner and did not speak. He displayed minimal bradykinetic movement to noxious stimuli, and had symmetric 1/5 strength on Ashworth scale. By the ninth day, serum CPK peaked at 494 IU/L. He produced rare, hypophonic, lucid speech and followed simple commands. Neuropsychiatric evaluation revealed profound memory loss.",0
"A right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy excluded inflammation, fibrosis, or toxic inclusions on day 12. The ejection fraction normalized (57%). Nerve conduction velocities were normal. EMG demonstrated myopathy in multiple myotomes. Muscle biopsy showed mild focal endomysial inflammation, with normal blood vessels and muscle architecture.",0
"At 27 days the patient’s affect was brighter, with rare, hypophonic speech; he had 3/5 antigravity limb movement. Over the next 8 weeks, his speech and language returned to normal and he walked independently. Despite 3 months of cognitive rehabilitation, he had significant anterograde and retrograde memory dysfunction and inefficient cognitive processing, suggesting medial temporal lobe dysfunction. MRI signal abnormalities were no longer present at 4 months.",0
"One year after 4-AP overdose, spontaneous speech, motor and verbal responses, strength, balance, and gait had improved to baseline status. He had difficulty with short-term memory and learning new tasks. Discussion. The cognitive deficits, abulia, and temporal lobe lesions on MRI are strikingly similar to findings in patients with HSV or paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis.5 Clinical and radiographic findings likely resulted from direct high-dose 4-AP toxicity to CNS neurons and cardiac and skeletal muscle.",0
"An infectious etiology is unlikely. Two CSF studies showed no lymphocytosis; CSF PCR for HSV and viral cultures were negative. Paraneoplastic disease is unlikely because of the acute onset and lack of progression. Morvan disease is unlikely in the absence of neuromyotonia and insidious clinical course, vs the acute onset in this patient.6",0

"Discussion. We report three cases of NMO spectrum disorder with restriction of NMO-IgG positivity to the CSF. The cases presented with rapidly relapsing LETM, and a normal or nondiagnostic brain MRI. While none showed evidence for ON, these individuals have been followed less than 2 years. In each case, the second relapse was severe and disabling, occurring within months of onset. In each patient, serum NMO-IgG testing was negative at a 1:120 dilution and simultaneous CSF NMO-IgG was positive during an exacerbation, before administration of corticosteroids. Antibody testing was performed by the same laboratory (Mayo Medical Laboratories). The cause of NMO-IgG seronegativity in these three CSFpositive patients is unknown. The presence of a coexisting, interfering antibody may hinder serologic interpretation. However, only case 3 was noted to have coexisting ANA. The CSF albumin indices indicated intact blood– brain barriers.",0

"Serum testing for NMO-IgG remains the standard test for confirming a diagnosis of relapsing NMO spectrum disorder. In our three seronegative cases of relapsing LETM, detection of NMOIgG in the CSF confirmed the diagnosis of an NMO spectrum disorder, and mandated initiation of immunosuppressive therapies. The potential value of early treatment emphasizes the importance of making the correct diagnosis.7 If NMO is strongly suspected and serum NMO-IgG is negative, measurement of CSF NMO-IgG is recommended and may add to the overall sensitivity of laboratory testing. Clinical scenarios that may warrant supplementary testing of CSF include the following: 1) LETM, 2) relapsing TM, 3) severe and bilateral ON, 4) ON with poor recovery, and",0
"5) rapidly relapsing ON. CSF studies should not be a substitute for serum testing. Larger systematic studies are required to determine the sensitivity and specificity of combined serum and CSF testing. Whether distinct clinical characteristics exist for cases with CSF restricted NMO-IgG positivity remains to be determined. From Washington University, St. Louis, MO.",0
