"BACKGROUND: Nuclear polymerase gamma (POLG) mutations are the most common cause of inherited mitochondrial disease. POLG mutation diseases have a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations; the lethal infantile form is myocerebrohepatopathy spectrum. PATIENT: A 4-month-old boy was referred for poor feeding, emesis, failure to thrive, and hypotonia. RESULTS: Brain computed tomography was normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging with and without contrast demonstrated bilateral enhancement of cranial nerves III, V-X, and the upper and midcervical nerve roots. Liver biopsy revealed early cirrhosis, steatosis, and focal necrosis. Muscle biopsy did not demonstrate speciﬁc abnormalities of mitochondrial morphology or number. Electron transport chain analysis of both ﬁbroblasts and muscle demonstrated deﬁciencies. Because of suspected mitochondrial depletion disorder, testing was performed for mitochondrial abnormalities including analysis of the POLG gene, which revealed two pathogenic mutations, c.1399G>A (p.A467T) and c.3285C>G (p.S1095R). CONCLUSIONS: We report abnormal gadolinium enhancement of multiple cranial nerves and cervical nerve roots in an infant with myocerebrohepatopathy spectrum disease whose brain MRI otherwise revealed only mild atrophy. Mitochondrial disease should be included in the differential diagnosis of cranial nerve enhancement. Contrast-enhanced MRI aids in the diagnostic evaluation of infants with developmental delay and suspected neurological disease.",1

Introduction Inherited mitochondrial diseases are most commonly associated with mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymerase, polymerase gamma 1 (POLG) gene.1 More than 160 pathogenic mutations in the POLG gene have been identiﬁed.2 Inheritance is usually autosomal recessive; however, autosomal dominant forms exist. POLG disease may present in children or adults. At least six distinct phenotypes with varying hepatic, musculoskeletal,",0

We describe abnormal gadolinium enhancement of multiple cranial nerves in an infant with POLG disease who otherwise had only mild signs of cortical and white matter atrophies on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This child expands the differential diagnosis of cranial nerve enhancement in infants with neurological disease and should prompt evaluation for POLG mutations in the appropriate clinical setting.

"A 4-month-old boy was referred for poor feeding, emesis, failure to thrive, hypotonia, and elevated transaminases. He was the ﬁrst child of nonconsanguineous parents born at 39 weeks of gestation by vaginal delivery without signiﬁcant prenatal complications.

3.209 kg with head circumference in the eighty-eighth percentile. Apgar scores were 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes. Newborn screening test results were negative. Perinatal course was uneventful except hyperbilirubinemia at 1 week of age treated with phototherapy. Family history was noncontributory.,1
"Examination on admission demonstrated an irritable nondysmorphic child with mild ptosis, poor head control, palpable liver edge 3 cm below the costal margin, decreased muscle mass, central hypotonia, and absent deep tendon reﬂexes. Head circumference had decreased to the thirteenth percentile. Initial laboratory tests demonstrated elevated levels of direct bilirubin 2.8 mg/dL (normal [nl] <0.6 mg/dL), indirect bilirubin",1
"1.3 mg/dL (nl, 0.1-1.0 mg/dL), aspartate aminotransferase 448 U/L (nl, 5105 U/L), alanine aminotransferase 167 U/L (nl, 7-110 U/L), and Lactate dehydrogenase 2221 U/L (nl, 600-1400 U/L). The plasma lactate level peaked at 12.3 mmol/L (nl, 0.5-2.2 mmol/L). The cerebrospinal ﬂuid protein level was 1113 mg/dL (nl, 15-45 mg/dL). An abdominal ultrasonography demonstrated gallbladder sludge. Noncontrast brain computed tomography scan was normal.",1
"The clinical phenotype of poor head control and progressive weakness of the upper extremities suggested a mitochondrial disorder and prompted a brain MRI to investigate the possibility of metabolic stroke or basal ganglia abnormalities. The MRI with and without intravenous contrast demonstrated bilateral enhancement of cranial nerves (CN) III and V-X, as well as dorsal nerve root enhancement in the visualized portion of the cervical spine (Figure A-E). Dedicated spine imaging was not performed. The MRI also revealed prominent subarachnoid spaces and ventricle size indicative of cortical and white matter atrophy (Figure F) in the setting of a small and decreasing head circumference. No additional MRI abnormalities were observed. The myelination pattern was normal for age (Figure F,G). Galactocerebrosidase and arylsulfatase",1
"A activities were normal. Testing for spinal muscular atrophy, tyrosinemia type 1, galactosemia, mitochondrial genome mutations, pyruvate disorders, Niemann-Pick disease, and peroxisomal defects were also unremarkable.",0
"Three weeks after admission, the child worsened. He developed hypoxia, ascites, tachycardia, intermittent fevers, and sepsis. Liver biopsy revealed ﬁndings of early cirrhosis, steatosis, and focal necrosis. Electron transport chain (ETC) analysis of ﬁbroblasts was consistent with complex III deﬁciency. Muscle biopsy did not demonstrate speciﬁc abnormalities of mitochondrial morphology or number. Type 1 muscle ﬁbers were predominant and shorter than expected. Some severely cytochrome oxidase-deﬁcient muscle ﬁbers were present. No mtDNA mutations or deletions were observed. However, muscle ETC analysis revealed deﬁciencies in all ETC complexes except complex II. In particular, deﬁciencies in complexes I and IV met major modiﬁed Walker criterion. Because of suspicion for a mitochondrial depletion disorder, testing to include analysis of the POLG gene revealed two pathogenic mutations, c.1399G>A (p.A467T) and c.3285C>G (p.S1095R).",1
"The patient died at 7 months of age because of respiratory failure. Discussion Polymerase gamma 1 (POLG) is a nuclear-encoded enzyme responsible for the replication and maintenance of the mtDNA genome. Faulty POLG activity induces mutations within the mtDNA that translate into depletions of mtDNA copy number, single-nucleotide substitutions, and multiplenucleotide deletions.2 These alterations correlate with FIGURE.",1

"severe deﬁcits in functioning of the ETC complex, the facilitator of oxidative phosphorylation. All the known pathogenic mutations in the POLG gene have been compiled into a National Institutes of Health database (http://tools.niehs. nih.gov/polg/). The most common mutation responsible for POLG-associated mitochondrial disease is c.1399G>A (p.A467T), either homozygous or compound heterozygous with another mutation.1 Tang et al.2 catalogued a large series of patients with POLG mutations, and only our patient had compound heterozygosity for c.1399G>A (p.A467T) and c.3285C>G (p.S1095R). The latter has previously been reported as pathogenic, conﬁrming the clinical impression of POLG deﬁciency.1",0
"POLG mutations have a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations and age of onset. Liver, brain, and muscle are most commonly affected. At least six distinct phenotypes are recognized: (1) myocerebrohepatopathy spectrum (MCHS); (2) Alpers syndrome; (3) ataxia neuropathy spectrum; (4) myoclonus epilepsy myopathy sensory ataxia; (5) autosomal recessive progressive external opthalmoplegia; and (6) autosomal dominant progressive external opthalmoplegia.1 The MCHS phenotype describes the clinical picture of our patient (infantile presentation of hypotonia, myopathy, developmental delay, encephalopathy, and liver dysfunction) and is the form of POLG disease with the earliest age of onset.1 MCHS can be distinguished from the more common Alpers syndrome by the lack of seizures, liver pathology, and more severe myopathy.3 MCHS disease has also been attributed to other mitochondrial gene mutations, not solely POLG mutations.3",0
"Generally, infantile mitochondrial diseases have extensive white matter abnormalities including demyelination or delayed myelination, leukodystrophy, and cortical atrophy with or without gray matter nuclei abnormalities.4 Ferrari et al.3 reported a series of nine infants with POLG disease. The eight patients with Alpers syndrome had nonspeciﬁc white and gray matter MR abnormalities. One girl with a clinical picture of MCHS and multiple heterozygous POLG gene mutations presented at 3 months of age and died at 6 months. Her brain MRI was reportedly normal.",0
"Abnormal cranial nerve enhancement has not been reported in a POLG-associated mitochondrial disease. Cranial nerve enhancement has been reported along with widespread cerebral white matter abnormalities in adult mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy,5 and in childhood metabolic diseases including Krabbe disease and metachromatic leukodystrophy, both cranial nerve and cauda equina enhancement have been observed.6-9 Isolated cranial nerve enhancement signaled early infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy in one child.10",0
The mechanism behind enhancing cranial nerves has yet to be elucidated. Speculations include the breakdown of the blood-nerve barrier because of perivascular inﬂammation or inﬁltration and areas of active demyelination.6 Nerve enhancement could also originate from the cytotoxic buildup of metabolites that prevent normal myelination and facilitate demyelination in diseases such as metachromatic leukodystrophy.8,0
"Most articles describe MRI without contrast. This may explain the patient with MCHS who had a normal MRI in the study by Ferrari et al.3 Ganeson et al.7 advocated using contrast in the routine evaluation of infants with early onset of developmental delay when they identiﬁed a patient with early infantile Krabbe disease who had multiple enhancing cranial nerves along with nonspeciﬁc white matter changes at MRI. We are in agreement with Morana et al.,9 in hypothesizing that abnormal cranial nerve enhancement goes largely undetected because of the lack of administration of MRI contrast when evaluating infants.",0
"In conclusion, the differential diagnosis of abnormal cranial nerve enhancement should be expanded to include POLG mutations and, more generally, mitochondrial diseases if the appropriate clinical signs are present. We have modiﬁed our MR protocols to include contrast enhancement for infants with suspected neurometabolic disease. References Wong LJ, Naviaux RK, Brunetti-Pierri N, et al.
