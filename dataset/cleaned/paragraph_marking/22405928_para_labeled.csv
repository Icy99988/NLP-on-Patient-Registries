Mutations in POLG account for one of the most frequent nuclear encoded causes of mitochondrial disorders to date. Individuals harboring POLG mutations exhibit fairly heterogeneous clinical presentations leading to increasing difﬁculties in classifying these patients into deﬁned clinical phenotypes. This study aims to investigate the molecular basis of a mitochondrial cytopathy in a patient with 3-methylglutaconic aciduria and to expand the clinical phenotype associated with POLG mutations.,0
"Clinical, molecular and genetic analyses as well as neurophysiological examinations were carried out for a 23-year-old woman of mixed Caucasian and Latin American ancestry with a history of cataracts diagnosed at age 1year, she had onset of distal muscle weakness at age 2years progressing to atrophy and ovarian dysgenesis at puberty. The patient was found to have 3-methylglutaconic acid with normal 3 hydroxyisovaleric acid on urine organic acid analysis. POLG sequencing was done and a heterozygous variant, c.2851T>A (p.Y951N) was found which is predicted to be deleterious. There are limited reports of POLG mutations in individuals with 3-methylglutaconic aciduria. This case report of a young woman with a heterozygous mutation in POLG, presenting with muscle weakness and atrophy at a young age aims to aid clinicians in similar challenging diagnostic situations as well as enhances our understanding of POLG-related disease phenotypes.",1
"Published by Elsevier B.V. Introduction Human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is continuously replicated in dividing cells and postmitotic tissues by the nuclear-encoded DNA polymerase gamma (POLG). POLG is the sole mtDNA polymerase and plays a major role in maintaining mtDNA integrity (Milone and Massie, 2010). POLG is a heterotrimer and consists of a catalytic subunit (p140) and 2 smaller identical accessory subunits (p55). The catalytic subunit is encoded by POLG, whereas the accessory subunits are encoded by POLG2. POLG maps to 15q25 and POLG2 maps to 17q21.",0

"The catalytic subunit plays a critical role since it contains both polymerase and proofreading exonuclease activities (Longley et al., 2001). Mutations in POLG represent the most common causes of autosomally inherited mitochondrial diseases in children and adults (Wong et al., 2008). The ﬁrst mutation in POLG was discovered in 2001 in a Belgian family with Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (PEO) (Van Goethem et al., 2001). The phenotype of patients with POLG mutations is often heterogeneous and, as observed in other mitochondrial disorders, may lead to involvement of several organ systems. The reported POLG mutations are inherited either in an autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant manner (DiMauro et al., 2006; Horvath et al., 2006). Diagnosis in a clinical setting may pose a challenge to clinicians and molecular testing including sequencing of POLG in suspected cases can help to reach a diagnosis and institute proper counseling. In this report we present an adult patient with a complicated medical history where multiple evaluations had failed to arrive at a diagnosis until a novel POLG mutation, brieﬂy described in an earlier paper by Tang et al. (2011) was found. The clinical presentation of this patient and its association with a POLG mutation will add to our current knowledge and understanding of POLG-related disease phenotypes.",1

Bekheirnia et al. / Gene 499 (2012) 209–212 Subject and methods Study subject A 23-year-old woman of mixed Caucasian and Mexican descent was evaluated in the Adult Genetics clinic for a history of bilateral cataracts, ovarian dysgenesis and distal muscle weakness and atrophy. Several studies including genetic testing were undertaken over a period of several years to determine a diagnosis, until a ﬁnal diagnosis was reached that explained her presentation. Non-genetic investigations",1
"At age 18years, she had a syncopal episode at school and underwent a diagnostic work-up that included an echocardiogram, EKG, cardiac MRI, brain MRI without contrast and EEG. At age 19years, due to progressive muscle weakness, electromyogram (EMG) and nerve conduction velocities (NCV) were carried out. Based on those results, a skeletal muscle biopsy was undertaken to understand the muscular atrophy. In the Genetics clinic, biochemical testing was sent for acylcarnitine analysis, plasma amino acids, urine organic acids, lactic acid levels, liver function tests and basic metabolic panel. An echocardiogram to determine structural anomalies of the heart was also ordered. A galactose 1-phosphate level was also obtained to rule out GALT deﬁciency due to the history of bilateral cataracts, ovarian dysgenesis and neurological compromise.",1
Genetic testing DNA tests for spinal muscular atrophy and myotonic dystrophy were sent. Sequencing of GJB1 and MPZ was also performed as part of the evaluation for Charcot–Marie Tooth disease. An oligonucleotidebased chromosomal microarray analysis to rule out genomic copy number variants was sent. Based on her overall clinical picture at,0
"age 23years, it was decided to pursue a work-up for mitochondrial disease. Since mutations in POLG are associated with variable presentations that include but are not limited to encephalopathy, parkinsonism, stroke-like episodes, exercise intolerance, ataxia–neuropathy and PEO (progressive external ophthalmoplegia) and limb myopathy, POLG sequencing was pursued. Subsequently, MitoMet array (copy number analysis of metabolic and mitochondrial related genes) was also performed to evaluate for deletions in the POLG gene. Results Clinical history of the subject",1
"The subject was healthy at birth with no signiﬁcant problems during the ﬁrst year of life. At the age of 1year, she developed vision problems and was found to have bilateral cataracts which were removed. At the age of 2years, she manifested increasing difﬁculties with motor movements of both hands that led to delayed ﬁne motor skills which continued to progress, leading to the inability to use both of her hands, with consequent atrophy of arm and hand muscles. At the age of 16years she had a gynecological evaluation due to absent menarche which resulted in the diagnosis of ovarian dysgenesis. Hormone replacement therapy was initiated with appropriate response. At the age of 18years, she had a syncopal episode at school. At the age of 23years, she presented with a seizure like episode of unknown etiology. The episode consisted of generalized",1
"tonic–clonic convulsions without loss of bowel or bladder continence or tongue bite; however, she developed post-ictal confusion. Two months later, she was evaluated at the Adult Genetics clinic. At that time, she was attending college and exhibited an intact cognitive function. Family history was non-contributory for any history of similar conditions. The patient has one sibling, a 24year old brother, who was diagnosed with depression. Clinical ﬁndings in the subject on physical examination (see Supplemental ﬁgure online)",1
"The patient was a thin young woman with a height of 170.2cm (75th–90th percentile) and a weight of 53.9kg (25th percentile). She had remarkable atrophy of arm and hand muscles but no facial dysmorphic features. Pupils were irregular and sluggish bilaterally. On neurological examination she was alert and oriented. There were no cranial nerve deﬁcits and her coordination was normal. There was severe atrophy of arm and hand muscles including biceps, tri-",1
"ceps, forearm and hands with claw hand deformity and digitalization of the thumbs. However, deltoid muscles had normal bulk and tone. Lower extremities were diffusely thin and feet arches were normal. Motor examination in upper extremities revealed her power to be 0/5 at wrist ﬂexors and extensors, hand and forearm and 0/5 at biceps; however, it was 5/5 at deltoid muscles and 3/5 at triceps. At the lower extremities, her power was 5/5 in proximal muscles including hip ﬂexors, quadriceps and hamstrings and 4/5 at tibialis anterior. She displayed absent reﬂexes in upper extremities, whereas her lower extremities had normal symmetric reﬂexes at knees and ankles. The rest of the examination was unremarkable.",1
Results of non-genetic investigations,0
"Echocardiogram, EKG, cardiac MRI, brain MRI without contrast and EEG done at the age of 18years did not detect any abnormalities. NCV revealed diffusely decreased amplitude of compound motor action potentials with otherwise normal motor and sensory responses including sural responses. EMG revealed mixed short and long duration motor unit potentials with normal ﬁring frequency suggestive of a chronic myopathic process affecting the distal muscles although the pattern could also be seen in patients with chronic neurogenic conditions. Skeletal muscle biopsy revealed severe myoﬁber degeneration and on electron microscopy there was evidence of end stage muscle disease that precluded interpretation.",1
Urine organic acid analysis showed presence of 3-methylglutaconic acid with normal 3 hydroxyisovaleric acid excluding the possibility of 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type I. All other biochemical tests were normal. Results of genetic testing,1
"POLG sequencing revealed a heterozygous variant, c.2851T>A (p.Y951N). Mitomet array was normal excluding a deletion on the other POLG allele. Neither parent carried the c.2851T>A (p.Y951N) POLG variant. As there are reports of multiple mtDNA deletions in both dominant and recessive forms of POLG11, a repeat muscle biopsy was considered to look for deletions and to characterize the muscle involvement better. However, the patient declined a repeat biopsy. All other genetic tests were normal. Discussion",1
"The clinical presentation associated with POLG mutations is very heterogeneous. The different clinical phenotypes include: 1) Alpers syndrome 2) PEO with or without Limb Myopathy 3) PEO, Parkinsonism, and Early Menopause 4) Ataxia Neuropathy Spectrum (ANS) disorders 5) Myocerebrohepatopathy Spectrum disorders (MCHS) and",0
"6) Myoclonus Epilepsy Myopathy Sensory Ataxia (MEMSA) (Wong et al., 2008). In this report we describe a 23-year-old woman with cataracts, ovarian dysgenesis and early-onset distal muscle weakness. This patient does not ﬁt into any of the prior classiﬁcations although there are some similarities with the phenotypes reported previously. M.R. Bekheirnia et al. / Gene 499 (2012) 209–212 211",1
"Individuals with early menopause, as well as patients with peripheral neuropathy and/or cataracts have been described in the literature (Milone and Massie, 2010). The presence of ovarian dysgenesis seems to be a variable phenotype similar to early menopause and premature ovarian failure (Ledig et al., 2010). Premature ovarian failure is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by amenorrhea and high serum gonadotropins in women less than 40years old. Ovarian dysgenesis which is characterized by the loss of follicles before puberty, describes the most severe premature ovarian failure outcome (Ledig et al., 2010). Multiple different genetic and non-genetic factors are known to play a role in the development of premature ovarian failure and ovarian dysgenesis (Ledig et al., 2010). Although premature ovarian failure has been described in patients with POLG mutations (Tong et al., 2010), ovarian dysgenesis has not been reported before and to the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report that links ovarian dysgenesis with a POLG mutation.",0
"Although cataracts are not a common clinical ﬁnding associated with mitochondrial disorders, it has been reported in a mitochondrial disorder called Sengers syndrome (Atiq et al., 2004) which is characterized by congenital cataracts, lactic acidosis, skeletal myopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In addition, cataracts have also been described in Autosomal Dominant PEO (adPEO) caused by POLG mutations (Luoma et al., 2004). The mechanism is not known although it has been speculated that deﬁciency of glutathione may cause a significant increase in membrane permeability which in addition to the susceptibility of the lenses to oxidative damage may lead to inactivation of the Na+/K+ pump. This effect in turn may result in ionic changes and cataract development (Reddy et al., 1988).",0
"The onset of muscle weakness in this patient at such a young age is unusual for an autosomal dominant POLG mutation. Although distal myopathy has been previously described in POLG-related diseases (Giordano et al., 2010), it had an adult-onset. Skeletal muscle weakness and exercise intolerance can accompany PEO (Luoma et al., 2004); however, most of the previous reports with either neuropathy or myopathy caused by a heterozygous POLG mutation have been reported in older subjects (Milone and Massie, 2010; Wong et al., 2008). Inter-familial variation in the severity of muscle weakness has been reported (Luoma et al., 2004); however, this level of distal muscle atrophy at a very young age, observed in the current report is an intriguing ﬁnding associated with POLG mutations specially among heterozygous variants. This ﬁnding expands the clinical spectrum associated with POLG-associated disorders.",0
"Epilepsy is commonly observed in children and adults with recessive POLG mutations. Seizures may occur either in the setting of Alpers syndrome, in association with PEO, ataxia, and neuropathy, or as an isolated manifestation of POLG mutations (Atiq et al., 2004). Partial and secondary generalized seizures can occur. An occipital EEG focus has been reported in the majority of the patients. Epilepsy is a very important factor inﬂuencing mortality in patients with POLG mutations. Abnormal brain MRI ﬁndings may develop and cerebral infarct-like lesions have been reported (Deschauer et al., 2007; Engelsen et al., 2008; Tzoulis et al., 2006). Onset of seizures in adulthood as observed in our patient is more likely to be associated with a heterozygous mutation. However, it should be noted that the proband had only one seizure episode and her course could be unpredictable. It is not well known which antiepileptic drugs should be used as ﬁrst or second line agents in POLG-disease and many patients need combined antiepileptic therapy. However, it is well established that sodium valproate should be avoided in POLGdisease or suspected POLG-disease due to the risk of hepatotoxicity and possible liver failure (Kollberg et al., 2006; Tzoulis et al., 2006). The need to avoid valproic acid as an antiepileptic therapy has been emphasized to our proband.",0
"A heterozygous POLG variant c.2851T>A (p.Y951N) was identiﬁed in this patient. Computational predictive programs, SIFT and PolyPhen, suggest that this change may be pathogenic. The critical role",1
"of tyrosine at position 951 of POLG in the same patient is recently summarized by Tang et al. (2011). As it has been previously discussed, tyrosine at this position is highly conserved across different species. It should be noted that Y951 is one of the crucial residues involved in binding incoming nucleotides based on the structure analysis provided in Fig. 1. Enzyme kinetic analysis using a mutant p.Y951A had nearly no polymerase activity of POLG, but maintained the same DNA binding afﬁnity to a DNA template (Lim et al., 2003). Furthermore, p.Y951F, which lacks a phenolic hydroxyl atom, interferes with binding and incorporating incoming deoxynucleotides (Lim et al., 2003). Thus, the presence of the hydroxyl atoms of tyrosine at position 951 appears to be fundamental to incorporate the deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTPs) and to facilitate the nucleotidyl transferase reaction. According to the classiﬁcation of pathogenic mutations proposed in the original POLG structure determination publication (Lee et al., 2009), p.Y951N change would belong to class I mutations which interfere with the catalytic active-site conﬁguration of the POLG enzyme leading to impaired enzymatic activity. Moreover, another class I mutation (p.Y955C change), located at the polymerase catalytic domain of POLG, has been associated with adPEO. This mutation has been shown to be associated with decreased binding afﬁnity to incoming nucleotides, and increased error-rate of polymerase reaction (Graziewicz et al., 2004; Ponamarev et al., 2002). Structurally, the amino acid Y955 is located adjacent to Y951 and their side chain atoms are tightly packed by hydrophobic interactions. Thus, the p.Y955C change is likely to have a direct inﬂuence on the conformation of Y951. It has been proposed that both Y951 and Y955 are parts of the nucleoside binding site of POLG (Lee et al., 2009) and given their intimate chemical interactions, the classiﬁcation of the observed de novo variant in the case herein presented is in line with the dominant phenotype observed and is consistent with other mutations observed in this critical region.",0
"In addition to the evidence for a phenotypic effect caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in our proband, there are also reports of autosomal dominant POLG mutations in the literature (Wong et al., 2008). To determine whether the detected mutation was pathogenic, the parents were tested. Since they had a normal phenotype, presence of this mutation in either of them would point in favor of a familial variant. Parental testing revealed that neither parents were carriers, thus establishing that this was a de novo event in",0

"Another possibility was that the patient had one mutated allele and a second deleted allele which would establish an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. To clarify this further, a MitoMet array was performed which did not demonstrate any copy number variation on the other copy of the POLG gene, thus establishing that the de novo variant, p.Y951N is likely a dominant mutation. However, a second mutant allele deeply embedded in the introns or in the promoter region cannot be ruled out. This patient presented with 3-methylglutaconic acid with normal",0
"3 hydroxyisovaleric acid on urine organic acid analysis. 3Methylglutaconic aciduria (3-MGCA) has 5 distinctive clinical types (Gunay-Aygun, 2005). An elevated amount of 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid (3-HIV) is seen in type I in contrast to normal levels in the other types. In 3-MGCA Type IV, which is mostly connected with mitochondrial dysfunction, most patients present early in life with nonspeciﬁc neurological features like psychomotor retardation and muscle tone abnormalities; however, there have been reports of sensorineural hearing loss and ocular abnormalities including cataracts as observed in our patient (Gunay-Aygun, 2005). A potential association between 3-MGCA and POLG mutations has been published previously by Wortmann et al., 2009. The authors studied 18 children with 3-MGCA type IV with 4 clinical subgroups (encephalomyopathic, hepatocerebral, cardiomyopathic, myopathic). In the children with a hepatocerebral phenotype most with complex I deﬁciency, 3 out of",0
"6 carried either homozygous or compound heterozygous POLGmutations, indicating autosomal recessive inheritance (Wortmann et al., 2009). This current report is yet an evidence of an association between 3-MGCA and POLG-disease.",0
"In summary, the clinical presentation of POLG mutations is fairly heterogeneous and it is difﬁcult to classify patients into speciﬁc syndromes. Here we present a new clinical presentation with cataracts, ovarian dysgenesis and an unusual early onset of distal muscle atrophy and weakness as a result of a heterozygous POLG mutation. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of a deep intronic mutation or a change in the promoter. The possibility of a digenic cause for the observed phenotype as well as distal myopathy of other etiology should also be considered. This report is also an evidence of association between 3-MGCA and an apparently heterozygous POLG mutation.",0
Structural modeling of POLG-nucleotide template and molecular analysis,0
"The structural model of human mitochondrial DNA polymerase was constructed based upon the 3.24Å protein structure (PDB accession code: 3IKM) and an extended DNA template from the solved crystal structure of T7 DNAP-DNA complex (PDB accession code: 1T8E) (Brieba et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2009).
