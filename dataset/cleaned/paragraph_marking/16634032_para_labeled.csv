"Results: No mutations were found in the genes for parkin or PINK1. Muscle biopsies showed ragged-red and cytochrome c oxidase–negative fibers, and biochemistry showed decreased activities of respiratory chain complexes containing mitochondrial DNA–encoded subunits. Multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions were seen by long polymerase chain reaction, and sequencing of the POLG gene showed that the patients were compound heterozygous for two patogenic mutations.

"Mitochondrial involvement in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) was suspected since the late 1980s, when respiratory chain complex I activity was found to be reduced in tissues from patients (reviewed in Mizuno and colleagues1) and in animals intoxicated with the PD-inducing molecule 1-methyl-4-phenyl1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP).2 It was also suggested that PD may result from excessive age-related accumulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in the substantia nigra, but this mechanism was never convincingly substantiated.3 However, in the past few years, mutations in three nuclear genes encoding the mitochondrial protein PINK1 and two proteins",0

"and early-onset forms of PD.4–6 Mutations in the catalytic subunit of mtDNA polymerase gamma (POLG), a nuclear-encoded protein involved in the synthesis, replication, and repair of mtDNA, have been associated with depletion or multiple deletions of mtDNA in a striking variety of neurological phenotypes, including progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, and an infantile hepatocerebral disorder known as Alpers’ syndrome.7,8 Several families harboring mutations in POLG suffered from parkinsonism, usually associated with other clinical manifestations, most commonly PEO.7–9",0
"Here, we describe two sisters with early-onset par- kinsonism and neuropathy but without PEO, who were compound heterozygotes for two autosomal recessive POLG mutations, one in the polymerase domain and the other in the linker region of the enzyme. Patients and Methods Patients Two sisters, ages 27 (Patient 1) and 33 (Patient 2), the only children of nonconsanguineous parents, were normal at birth and through childhood except for migraine headaches and anxiety.",1
"When first seen at age 26, Patient 1 had dystonic toe curling, postural-action tremor of all limbs, reduced arm swing, hyporeflexia, “foot numbness,” and mild distal weakness of toes and fingers. An electromyogram showed lengthdependent axonal predominantly sensory neuropathy. Within 1 year, she developed facial masking, hypophonia, cogwheeling of the wrists, stooping, shuffling gait, bradykinesia, and positive pull test. Resting venous lactate was elevated (2.5 and 3.1mmol/L; reference range, 0.93–1.65mmol/ L). Serum creatine kinase was normal. Because of her sister’s intolerance to carbidopa/L-dopa (Sinemet), she was started on pramipexole (0.5mg three times daily), with moderate improvement of her action tremor.",1
"Patient 2 presented at age 20 with dystonic toe curling, intermittent action tremor of all limbs, and facial masking and stiffness, leading to the diagnosis of parkinsonism. At age 27, she developed numbness in her feet, and a year later, when seen at the Mayo Clinic, she had signs of both parkinsonism (bradykinesia, stooped posture, and rigidity) and peripheral neuropathy (bilateral stocking and glove sensory deficits). An electromyogram showed axonal sensorimotor, predominantly sensory neuropathy. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed moderate generalized cerebral and cerebellar atrophy. Serum lactate and creatine kinase values were normal. Her tremor improved on a low dose of carbidopa/levodopa (25/100 immediate-release tablet three times daily); higher doses caused severe oral dyskinesia.",1

"The muscle biopsy from Patient 1 showed 2 to 3% ragged-red fibers (RRFs) and cytochrome c oxidase– deficient fibers. Focal fiber–type grouping and scarce targetoid structures were also seen. Common mtDNA mutations for MELAS (mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes), MERRF (myoclonic epilepsy and ragged-red fiber disease), and neuropathy, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa (NARP) were absent. Biochemical studies of mitochondrial enzyme showed increased citrate synthase activity. When normalized to the nucleus-encoded citrate synthase, the activities of respiratory chain complexes containing mtDNA-encoded subunits were decreased, varying from 10 to 18% of normal (data not shown). Both histological and biochemical abnormalities were consistent with mitochondrial proliferation and a defect of mitochondrial protein synthesis.",1
The muscle biopsy specimen from Patient 2 showed,1
"1 to 2% RRFs, which were cytochrome c oxidase deficient, mild focal fiber–type grouping, and sparse targetoid fibers consistent with neuropathy. The activity of citrate synthase was not increased, but when respiratory chain enzyme activities were referred to the activity of succinate dehydrogenase, another nucleusencoded enzyme, all complexes containing mtDNAencoded subunits were decreased, with residual activities varying from 40 to 60% of normal (data not shown). Real-time PCR showed only 37% mtDNA depletion, and Southern blot analysis for multiple deletions was negative on two occasions. However, long PCR assays showed multiple deletions. Direct sequencing of the mtDNA genes encoding the seven subunits of complex I, cytochrome b, and 12S RNA demonstrated only some known nonpathogenic polymorphisms. The nuclear genes encoding parkin and PINK1 were also normal. However, DNA and cDNA sequencing of the catalytic subunit of POLG (GenBank accession numbers NP_002684 and NM_002693) showed the already reported R853W mutation in exon",1

"dir-apps.niehs.nih.gov/polg/index.cfm?edit=allPolg). We consider these mutations to be pathogenic for several reasons. First, although the clinical phenotype is atypical, there is a good correlation between genotype and biochemical and molecular phenotype. Second, the R853W mutation, already documented as pathogenic, is in the polymerase domain, where the catalytic function resides, whereas the novel mutation affects the linker region, and changes in this domain have been associated with severe manifestations.16 Third, this latter mutation alters a highly conserved site (Table 1). Finally, both mutations were absent in more than 100 controls.",1
"The clinical presentation in these sisters was dominated by parkinsonism and peripheral neuropathy. This disorder differed from idiopathic PD because of early onset, symmetrical involvement, postural-action tremor (but no resting tremor) in the four limbs, and incomplete L-dopa response in both patients. The clinical and electrophysiological evidence of a predominantly sensory polyneuropathy was also distinctive and atypical for PD. Anxiety was notable in both sisters and dated back to childhood in Patient 1. This is interesting because anxiety is commonly experienced by patients with idiopathic PD and may precede motor symptoms by two decades or more.17 The presenting",1

"In contrast, in the absence of PEO, no clinical clues pointed to a mitochondrial disorder, which was suggested only by the increased blood lactate in Patient 1 and by the cytochrome c oxidase–negative RRFs in the muscle biopsies of both patients. Parkinsonism has been described in a few families with mtDNA mutations, including a microdeletion in the cytochrome b gene18 and a mutation in the 12S ribosomal RNA gene,19 but is not a common presentation of primary mtDNA-related syndromes.",1
"In contrast, parkinsonism has been reported in several patients with PEO and multiple mtDNA deletions in muscle due to mutations in POLG1. The largest series included seven families from Finland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, and the clinical picture was characterized by PEO, parkinsonism, and premature menopause.9 Transmission was autosomal recessive in one family and autosomal dominant in all others. We have also described a US family with autosomal dominant PEO, neuropathy, hypogonadism, and parkinsonism.20 There are several interesting differences between the patients in these families and the two sisters described here. First, all other patients had PEO, which had invariably preceded the appearance of parkinsonism by several years. Second, the age at onset of parkinsonism ranged from 36 to 75 years in the European families and was 46 years in the US patient, whereas both sisters described here started showing parkinsonian symptoms in their 20’s. Interestingly, the age at onset was younger (36 – 46 years) in the one European family with autosomal recessive inheritance, and those patients were, similar to ours, compound heterozygotes for POLG mutations. Third, parkinsonism was part of complex syndromes in previous reports, whereas the only major additional clinical feature in our patients was peripheral neuropathy. As a consequence, these two sisters presented as juvenile PD, leading us to suspect PINK1 mutations before sequencing POLG, a step that was motivated by the coexistence of peripheral neuropathy and by presence of RRFs and multiple",0

"Methods: The [1-13C]glycine breath test was performed in 10 control subjects and 5 glycine encephalopathy patients with GLDC mutation, including 1 patient with mild glycine encephalopathy. Results: All the patients showed lower 13CO2 excretion than any control subject. Interpretation: Not only typical GE but also atypical GE can be reliably diagnosed by the 13C-glycine breath test. Because it is rapid, non-invasive, and requires little expertise, the breath test could be useful as a standard test for diagnosing GE. Ann Neurol 2006;59:862– 867",0
