"Symmetric hyperintense signal abnormality and enlarged inferior olives on (A) fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and (B) T2 images, characteristic of bilateral hypertrophic olivary degeneration. Additional findings included hyperintense T2 signal changes in the thalami and deep cerebellar nuclei and mild cerebellar vermis atrophy (C).",1
"A 30-year-old man with sensorineural hearing loss presented with subacute somnolence, slurred speech, and unsteady gait following treatment with peginterferon a-2b and ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C virus. Examination revealed scanning speech, horizontal nystagmus, gait ataxia, and symmetric hyporeflexia with distal sensory loss. There was no palatal myoclonus. Metabolic and serologic workup and blood lactate were unrevealing. Brain MRI demonstrated bilateral hypertrophic olivary degeneration (HOD, figure). Whole exome sequencing identified a homozygous pathogenic p.W748S POLG mutation.1 Differential diagnosis of bilateral HOD includes mutations in the nuclear genes crucial to mitochondrial function, POLG and SURF1.2",1
