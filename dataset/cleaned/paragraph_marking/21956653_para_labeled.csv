"Reversible Parkinsonism Due to Involvement of Substantia Nigra in Epstein-Barr Virus Encephalitis Although the prevalence of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection in general population is high, it is uncommon that EBV infection causes Parkinsonism, especially injuring substantia nigra directly. We report a case of reversible Parkinsonism due to involvement of substantia nigra in EBVrelated encephalitis. Case Report",0
"A 24-year-old female teacher presented with fever, headache, and vomiting. Then an akinetic-rigid syndrome with tremor developed several days later. There was no family or personal history of movement disorders or other neurological or psychiatric diseases. Exposure to toxic substances or illicit drugs was denied. The cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) examination showed normal chlorine and glucose content, but there were 50 white blood cells per cubic millimetre and slightly elevated protein content. CSF culture did not grow any organisms. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) levels of antiEBV–viral capsid antigen (VCA) were remarkably increased in serum and CSF. IgG levels of anti-EBV-VCA were increased in serum but not detectable in CSF. Anti–EpsteinBarr nuclear antigen (EBNA) antibodies were not detectable in either serum or CSF. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed bilateral substantia nigra lesions on admission. After a 2-month treatment with Madopar, the patient recovered completely without any sequelae. Madopar was slowly tapered off and withdrawn. A repeated MRI after 3 months showed resolution of the lesions (Fig. 1).",0
"Discussion This patient ﬁrst presented with fever, headache, and vomiting, followed by an akinetic-rigid syndrome with tremor developing several days later. Clinical, historical, and investigative data ruled out iatrogenic, toxic, genetic, and other secondary causes. Although no virus has been isolated from our patient, we believe that she had postencephalitic Parkinsonism, as suggested by a history and serologic and CSF evidence. The MRI showed isolated involvement of the sub-",0

"stantia nigra and no lesions or signs of demyelination elsewhere in the brain; thus, it was conﬁrmed that damage to the substantia nigra alone could produce clinical features of PD. Although several viruses are known to cause Parkinsonism,1 it is uncommon that a virus could have produced lesions predominantly in the substantia nigra and have caused reversible Parkinsonism. Such selective lesions have demonstrated with toxins such as 1-methyl-4-phenyl1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP).2 However, the current study demonstrates the capability of a virus to do so. Hsieh et al.3 reported the case of a boy who presented with reversible Parkinsonism as the major symptom of EBV encephalitis. Brain single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed diminished perfusion in the region of the right caudate nucleus and no abnormalities in substantia nigra. Roselli et al.4 also reported a case of reversible Parkinsonism associated with EBV encephalitis and antineuronal antibodies detected in a human neuroblastoma cell line, which suggests that an autoimmune mechanism may play an important pathophysiological role. However, MRI showed no abnormalities in substantia nigra in these 2 cases, which was different from our case. Our observation indicates a direct acute neurotropic effect of EBV on nigral dopaminergic cells. The patient showed a substantial response in the acute phase to dopaminergic medication. During the treatment, this patient did not develop L-dopa–related dyskinesias or wearing off. We will follow this patient to observe whether she develops PD later.",0

"In conclusion, our report indicates that EBV infection can injure substantia nigra directly and cause reversible Parkinsonism. Nevertheless, given the high prevalence of EBV infection in the general population, EBV testing can be worthwhile in acute-onset movement disorders, especially those manifesting with Parkinsonism.

Descriptive statistics and normality testing were performed for all variables. Logarithmic transformations were made where necessary to normalize the data.,0
"The BRAIN test reports 4 variables: kinesia score (KS), number of alternating key taps in 60 seconds; akinesia time (AT), mean dwell time on each key in milliseconds (ms); dysmetria score (DS), weighted index using the number of incorrectly hit keys corrected for speed; and arrhythmia score (AS), variance of the time interval between keystrokes. Our preliminary results give the following means (with 25th and 75th percentiles) for PD patients (n ¼ 38 tests): KS 91.6 taps (73.5, 110.8); AT 169 ms (86, 237); DS 2.88 (2.39, 3.34); and AS 4.45 (4.17, 4.79).",0
"In the previous version of the BRAIN test, the variable that correlated best with the UPDRS was KS. Using 2-tailed Pearson’s tests and linear regression on the current data, signiﬁcant correlations were seen between UPDRS and KS, and component UPDRS scores and KS (Fig. 1A–E).

"kinson’s disease (PD) in different ethnic populations.1,2 To date, almost 300 mutations have been identiﬁed in the GBA gene, of which the N370S, L444P mutations are the most common.1 At the same time the N370S and L444P variants are the most frequent mutations in the GBA gene among GD patients in Russia, accounting for 45% and 23% of the mutant alleles, respectively.3 GBA mutation frequency among PD patients in Russia has not yet been investigated.",0
"Here we examined a possible association of L444P, N370S mutations with PD in Russia. The study was approved by the local ethics committee. The data set was composed of 330 unrelated PD cases (mean age, 63.8 6 9.8 years) and 240 controls (mean age, 67.7 6 8.8 years). All subjects were residents of the northwestern region of Russia. One hundred patients had familial PD (mean age, 62.7 6 10.3 years). Eighty-ﬁve patients had early-onset PD (::;50 years old): mean age, 55.5 6 11.1 years; mean age of onset,",0
"43.6 6 5.8 years. To screen N370S, L444P mutations in patients and controls, pair primers and corresponding restriction enzymes were used as previously described.4 All found mutations were veriﬁed by direct sequencing of PCR products. Mutation frequencies in patients and controls were compared using chi-square adjustment. Odds ratios with 95% conﬁdence intervals were calculated to test the association between the GBA mutations and PD.",0
"The distributions and association of GBA mutations in patients and controls are shown in Table 1. Heterozygous GBA mutations were detected in 9 PD patients (2.7%) and 1 subject in the control group (0.4%); P ¼ .038. The L444P mutation was more common in our sample of PD patients than the N370S, as was previously shown for other non-Jewish cohorts.1 Inversely, the N370S mutation dominated among GD patients in Russia.3 To date, several studies have reported full GBA sequencing, estimating the odds ratio for carrying a GBA mutation in a subject with PD as 5.43 (95% CI, 3.89–7.57),2 which is compatible with the sixfold increase of PD in L444P, N370S carriers revealed in our study.",0
"Most published studies speciﬁcally investigated sporadic PD. In our study we showed the increased frequency of the L444P mutation in familial PD. The association of GBA variants with familial PD was also reported in the PROGENI study.5 It was established earlier that parkinsonism associated with a GBA mutation appears to phenotypically resemble sporadic PD, but an early disease onset was reported.1 In our study the frequency of the L444P mutation in patients with early-onset (::;50 years old) PD was the highest among the studied groups.",0
"In summary, we have demonstrated that GBA L444P, N370S mutations are found in Russian PD patients at the same frequencies as mutations in the LRRK2 gene.6,7 Our data indicate that the GBA L444P, N370S mutations are genetic susceptibility factors for Parkinson’s disease in Russia.

More recent studies have distanced these disorders from Gilles de la Tourette syndrome despite the publication of some cases with stimulusinduced tics5 and considered them to be factitious, psychogenic, or psychotic in origin.6 It was later proposed that there is a universal tendency to exaggerated startle in some individuals, which may be more or less exaggerated.7",0

He also developed severe echopraxia, which he could only brieﬂy suppress voluntarily and at the expense of chest pain. He involuntarily concentrates on the gestures of the person he talks to, rather than the content of the conversation. He cannot watch television because he becomes extremely exhausted by echopraxia.

"FOXG1 haploinsufﬁciency is a rare cause of complex developmental encephalopathy due to de novo intragenic mutations of the Forkhead box G1 (FOXG1) gene, large deletions encompassing the gene, or disruption of cis-regulatory elements.1 The typical FOXG1 syndrome, a key differential diagnosis of Rett syndrome, is one of early-onset severe encephalopathy with microcephaly, and hand and tongue stereotypies. Less than 10% of the FOXG1 patients are able to walk.1 Mixed hyperkinetic, early-onset, movement disorders are also a hallmark of the syndrome. They are characterized by various combinations of chorea, dystonia, and athetosis. Clinical spectrum and disease’s course in adulthood are poorly known.1–3",0
"A 38-year-old female had no familial history of neurologic or psychiatric disorder. Pregnancy, delivery, and perinatal period were normal. She had severe psychomotor retardation from age 3 months. Microcephaly was noted from age 11 months (-2 standard deviations [SD]) and gradually worsened. She walked at age 5 years and never acquired language. Social interactions were very poor. She had pharmacoresponsive epilepsy with tonic-clonic seizures and stereotypies since childhood. Around the age of 30 years, according to the mother, although the date of onset could not be veriﬁed, she developed dyskinetic movement disorders with gradual worsening of walking difﬁculties. At age 38, she was treated with valproate (for 20 years) and lamotrigine (for 2 years) for epilepsy. She had microcephaly (head circumference -3.5 SD), and convergent strabismus. She had stereotypies with frequent rubbing/twiddling hand movements and occasional episodes of trunk rocking (see Video). She also had generalized dystonia with predominant craniofacial involvement, athetoid movements of the 4 limbs, and akinetic-rigid parkinsonism without tremor (see Video). There was no manifestation of vegetative dysfunction. At the last follow-up at age 41 years, the patient could still walk unaided.

"The FOXG1 mutation was absent in her mother but its de novo origin could not be ascertained, because of the father’s death. However, its causative role is highly probable: (1) it lies in the functionally critical DNA-binding forkhead domain of the protein; (2) it involves a residue highly conserved in different species; and (3) it was never found in 200 control females.",0
"Four adult FOXG1 patients have been previously reported (aged 18–31 years).1–3 None of them had been able to walk and there is no detailed information on the characteristics and course of their movement disorders. Our patient is the oldest reported FOXG1 case, which conﬁrms that prolonged survival into adulthood is possible. She has original phenotypic characteristics: (1) she was able to walk, accounting for a rare ‘‘mild’’ phenotype of the disorder; (2) dystonia and athetoid movements started later in life than in other reported FOXG1 patients1–5; (3) she had late-onset a kinetic-rigid parkinsonism similar to what has been reported in patients with Rett syndrome.6 Antiepileptic drugs might have contributed to the movement disorders, but the absence of a temporal link between drugs intake and their development, and the DaTSCAN abnormalities do not favor this hypothesis. Although we cannot exclude a co-occurrence of early-onset Parkinson’s disease and FOXG1 syndrome, our ﬁndings, based on this single case, suggest that dysfunction of the nigrostriatal pathway can result from FOXG1 mutations. A similar alteration has been evidenced in RTT patients.7",0

"Dystonia in Mitochondrial Spinocerebellar Ataxia and Epilepsy Syndrome Associated with Novel Recessive POLG Mutations Mutations in the polymerase c (POLG) gene cause a growing spectrum of autosomal dominant and recessive phenotypes. Chorea, myoclonus, ataxia, and parkinsonism can be observed; dystonia has been rarely described.1 We present a girl with mitochondrial spinocerebellar ataxia and epilepsy (MSCAE)2 who developed dystonia and is compound heterozygote for a novel combination of POLG mutations.",1
"Our patient presented elsewhere at age 15 years with generalized epilepsy and mild long-standing learning difﬁculties requiring special education. While taking valproate, she developed acute liver failure. A mitochondrial disorder was suspected in light of an older brother with infantile-onset seizures and developmental delay who died at age 18 months from valproate-associated liver failure. Laboratory investigations, including muscle biopsy for respiratory chain enzymes and mitochondrial DNA analysis, were normal. Nuclear DNA genetic analysis revealed compound heterozygosity for POLG gene mutation, p.W748S, and pT914P variant. At 16 years, she developed migraines, right-sided epilepsia partialis continua, myoclonic arm jerks, a pancerebellar syndrome, and progressive cognitive impairment. At 18 years, she noted episodic involuntary right foot in-turning. She developed head, left neck, and left shoulder tremor at age 20 and was referred to our service for treatment.",1
"Examination revealed mild external ophthalmoplegia, saccadic pursuit, writhing tongue movements, dysarthria, bilateral dysdiadochokinesis and dysmetria, and poor heel-toe walking. A mild left laterocollis, tremor of the left neck, and a ‘‘no-no’’ head tremor improved with a sensory trick. She had myoclonic and choreic ﬁnger and arm movements, dystonic posturing of hands and feet while walking, and striatal toes, more evident on the right. She had features of mild peripheral neuropathy. Plantar responses were ﬂexor (see Video).",1
"Brain MRI at age 15 (Fig. 1A,B) was compared to age 20 (Fig. 1C,D), which showed persistent thalamic and dentate nuclei T2 hyperintensity and increased signal change in the cerebellar hemispheres. Nerve conduction studies conﬁrmed mild sensory axonal peripheral neuropathy. Surface electromyography of the left sternocleidomastoid (Fig. 1E) showed a rhythmic 5to 6-Hz tremor without EEG correlate; back- *Correspondence to: Michael Samuel, King’s College Hospital, Department of Neurology, London, United Kingdom; m.samuel@nhs. net",1

"Mutations in the POLG gene are an uncommon, but important, cause of movement disorders. Our case demonstrates typical features of MSCAE: adolescent-onset ataxia, myoclonus, migraine, epilepsy, and neuropathy. External ophthalmoplegia and ptosis are reported in MSCAE and other POLG mutations, but tend to occur later.3 Severe liver disease can occur secondary to valproate treatment.4 Our patient’s tremor and cerebellar signs are possibly explained by cerebellar and thalamic involvement seen on MRI. However, the pathophysiology-MRI correlate of dystonia is not clear; it is also possible that other normal-appearing tissue is involved.",1
