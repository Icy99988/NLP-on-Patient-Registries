"Mutations in the mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma catalytic subunit (POLγ A) compromise the stability of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) by leading to mutations, deletions and depletions in mtDNA. Patients with mutations in POLγ A often differ remarkably in disease severity and age of onset. In this work we have studied the functional consequence of POLγ A mutations in a patient with an uncommon and a very severe disease phenotype characterized by prenatal onset with intrauterine growth restriction, lactic acidosis from birth, encephalopathy, hepatopathy, myopathy, and early death. Muscle biopsy identified scattered COX-deficient muscle fibers, respiratory chain dysfunction and mtDNA depletion. We identified a novel POLγ A mutation (p.His1134Tyr) in trans with the previously identified p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu double mutant. Biochemical characterization of the purified recombinant POLγ A variants showed that the p.His1134Tyr mutation caused severe polymerase dysfunction. The p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu mutation caused reduced polymerase function in conditions of low dNTP concentration that mimic postmitotic tissues. Critically, when p.His1134Tyr and p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu were combined under these conditions, mtDNA replication was severely diminished and featured prominent stalling. Our data provide a molecular explanation for the patients´ mtDNA depletion and clinical features, particularly in tissues such as brain and muscle that have low dNTP concentration.",1

"DNA polymerase gamma (POLγ ) is a nuclear-encoded protein that replicates mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Human POLγ is a heterotrimer comprising the catalytic POLγ A subunit and a dimeric POLγ B processivity factor [1]. POLγ A has 51−31 DNA polymerase and 31−51 exonuclease activities, maintaining a relatively constant mtDNA copy number [1,2]. Mutations in the gene encoding POLγ A (POLG) are a common cause of mitochondrial disease, ∗ Corresponding authors. E-mail addresses: niklas.darin@vgregion.se (N.

"The boy was the first child of healthy unrelated parents with no family history of neurological disease. The mother was healthy during pregnancy, which was complicated by intrauterine growth restriction of 35%, and birth was by cesarian section after 38+2 weeks of gestation (normal ∼ 40 weeks). Birth weight was 2380 g (- 2.5 SD), length was 47 cm (- 1.5 SD) and head circumference was 33 cm (- 1 SD). The APGAR score was normal (9–10–10). From the first day of life the boy was severely floppy with sucking difficulties requiring tube feeding. During the first week of age, blood lactate levels were increased up to 7–8 mmol/L (ref. v. <1.8) with pH 7.32 (ref. v. 7.35–7.45) and Base excess at −5 (ref. v. −3 – 3). The serum creatine kinase level (S-CK) was elevated at 1616 IU/L (ref.v. <170). The results from the polarography and spectrophotometry in isolated mitochondria were in the lower range of the controls but considered normal for a child as young as two weeks of age. A TORCH-screen showed IgG-antibodies against Toxoplasma Gondii, CMV and Parvovirus that were considered to have maternal origin. Mild anemia due to AO-immunization required blood transfusion, and a mild hypocalcemia was normalized upon calcium supplementation. Clinical examination revealed the absence of eye contact, infolded thumbs, backward bending of the head, dyskinetic movements and generalized muscular hypotonus with spared antigravity movements but no head control and the absence of muscle tendon reflexes. Cardiac investigations were normal. EEG was abnormal with decreased background activity of the left hemisphere. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed increased values for Tau and neurofilament light protein. Treatment with calcium, vitamin D, coenzyme Q10, thiamine, aspartic acid, carnitine and dichloroacetate had no apparent effect on the clinical condition which continued to worsen with deteriorating liver function and increasing lactic acidosis. The serum levels of alanine transaminase increased to 62.3 U/L (ref.v. < 47.9), aspartate transaminase to 142.5 U/L (ref.v. < 53.9) and international normalized ratio to 1.4 (ref.v.<1.2).

"A muscle biopsy from the vastus lateralis of the quadriceps muscle was performed at age 2 weeks. Isolation of mitochondria, oximetric measurements on fresh mitochondria, spectrophotometric enzyme analyses, as well as muscle biopsy for ultrastructural and enzyme histochemical analyses were performed essentially as previously described [11]. Immunohistochemistry was performed with monoclonal antibodies to complex IV subunit 1 (MTCO1; Abcam; 1:4000) and a mitochondrial marker (VDAC1; Abcam; 1:2000). Longrange PCR was used to detect possible mtDNA deletions essentially as previously described [12]. To quantify mtDNA levels, a TaqMan probe-based quantitative real-time PCR was performed, as previously described [13]. The ages of the controls (1–10) at the time of biopsy were the following: 11 year; 21 year; 310 months; 45 days; 52 months; 6-",0

The 150-bp paired-end reads were aligned to the reference genome (hg19) using the CLC Biomedical Genomics workbench (Qiagen). Data were analyzed using Ingenuity Variant Analysis (IVA) (www. ingenuity.com/products/variant-analysis). We searched for candidate genes potentially associated with mitochondrial disease and included all 1158 genes listed in MitoCarta2.0 [14], and the entire mtDNA. Further filtering was done for high quality variants classified as deleterious (missense, nonsense, indel and splice-site variants +/- 10 bp around exon boundaries) and rare (<0.5% minor allele frequency in the ExAC Browser, gnomAD or 1000 Genomes). Variants of interest were further evaluated using prediction tools: PhyloP, SIFT, PolyPhen-2, and MutationTaster. Sanger sequencing was used for confirmation and segregation analysis in the parents. For equivalent quantitation of the identified POLG mutations we analyzed RNA extracted from skeletal muscle specimen by PCR and Sanger sequencing. RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen) and reverse-transcribed into cDNA with the QuantiTect reverse transcription kit (Qiagen). PCR reactions were carried out at 25, 27 and 29 cycles respectively for all three variants and the PCR products were sequenced using standard techniques (PCR conditions and primers are available upon request).

"Whole-exome sequencing showed that the patient was heterozygous for three missense mutations in POLG, c.752C>T; p.Thr251Ile, c.1760C>T; p.Pro587Leu usually found in cis [19], and c.3400C>T; p.His1134Tyr. The variant c.3400C>T; p.His1134tyr with a CADD score of 28.800 was not present in the gnomAD and HGMD databases. The affected amino acid is in a highly conserved position among species with a Conservation phyloP p-value of 5.53 and is predicted to be highly pathogenic both by PolyPhen2 with a score of 1.00 and SIFT Function Prediction. The c.3400C>T originated from the father and the cis mutations from the mother (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, expression analysis on POLG cDNA from skeletal muscle specimens revealed approximately equal amounts of transcript from both alleles, excluding the possible involvement of a promoter variant in either allele (Supplementary Fig. 1).",1

"induces thermal destabilization (.6.Tm: - 2.3 °C) whereas the p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu double mutant shows near wildtype stability (Fig. 3A). This is in good agreement with the predicted .6.Gunf changes from the site directed mutator algorithm [20]. Modeling of the mutant POLγ A residues (Fig. 3B) show the p.His1134Tyr mutation located within the POLγ A active site where Asp890 and Glu1136 bind catalytically essential Mg2+ions whilst Tyr951 and Tyr955 on the catalytic O-helix are involved in dNTP binding/recognition (Fig. 3C). A Tyr1134 residue would likely protrude into the dNTP binding pocket, causing a steric clash with the incoming dNTP and displacement of the bound Mg2+ ions (Fig. 3C). The Pro587 interacts closely with the POLγ B accessory subunitwith a Leu587 residue causing a steric clash with the subunitwhilst the p.Thr251Ile mutation may result in the loss of two stabilizing H-bonds with Leu247 and Glu248 (Fig. 3D, E) that may cause a local structure change.",0
"p.His1134Tyr cannot support effective DNA synthesis To analyze the enzymatic properties of the POLγ mutants we tested their ability to bind a primed DNA template using EMSA. Both mutants bound DNA with the same affinity as wild type (Fig. 4A). Next, we conducted a coupled",0
"polymerase/exonuclease assay using the short template and different dNTP levels (Fig. 4B). The exonuclease activity of both mutants was similar to wild type (no dNTPs present, Fig. 4B, Supplementary Fig. 2A). However, p.His1134Tyr polymerization was reduced compared to p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu and wild type, particularly at low dNTP concentrations (Fig. 4B, lanes 7–10). On long ssDNA templates, p.His1134Tyr showed difficulty polymerizing even at high dNTP levels, whereas p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu behaved as wild type at all concentrations (Supplementary Fig. 2B and Fig. 4C).",0
"To study polymerase activity within the context of the core mitochondrial replisome (POLγ , TWINKLE and, mtSSB), we performed a rolling circle assay using a double-stranded circular DNA template with a pre-formed replication fork (Fig. 5A). We used very high dNTP levels (100 μM) since p.His1134Tyr requires higher dNTP concentration than normal (Fig. 4B). Similar to our previous assays, p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu synthesized long DNA stretches with an efficiency comparable to wild type, whereas p.His1134Tyr was inactive despite high dNTP levels (Fig. 5B).",0

"with non-dividing cells, where the dNTP concentration is considerably lower [21-23] than in our rolling circle assay (Fig. 5B). We therefore decided to investigate the effect of dNTP concentration in the rolling circle assay (Fig. 5C and D). Interestingly, at more physiological (1–10 μM) dNTP concentrations and on dsDNA templates, we now saw a strong reduction in DNA synthesis also with p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu. p.His1134Tyr in combination with p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu leads to replication stalling at low dNTP levels",0
"To mimic the DNA replication conditions within the patient cells, we mixed equimolar amounts of p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu and p.His1134Tyr in rolling circle assays at physiological dNTP concentrations (1 μM). We also reconstituted the parental situation where equimolar amounts of wild type and p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu or p.His1134Tyr were mixed. As expected, wild type supported robust levels of rolling circle replication (Fig. 5E, lanes 2–5 and Supplementary Fig. 2C). When p.His1134Tyr was added in combination with wild type, we noted a decrease in the formation of longer replication products and increased levels of a band just above 3 kb, corresponding to the size of the",0
"input template (Fig. 5E, lanes 6–9). This effect is frequently seen with POLγ variants that have problems with processive DNA synthesis. The polymerase binds to the free 31-end and performs an idling reaction, i.e. it switches between the polymerase and exonuclease mode, leading to a gradual increase in labeling of the input template. The effect was even more pronounced when we preincubated the template with p.His1134Tyr before wild type was added (Supplementary Fig. 2C), suggesting that p.His1134Tyr can compete with wild type for binding to the 31-end of the primer. Mixing of p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu with wild type had a milder effect on replisome function (Fig. 5E, lanes 10–13 and Supplementary Fig. 2C). When p.His1134Tyr and p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu were added together, replication was more severely disturbed (Fig. 5E, compare lanes 2–5 with 14–17 and Supplementary Fig. 2C), with lower levels of long replication products and increased labeling of the input template. The fact that the two mutations have additive, negative effects on replication correlates well with the more severe patient phenotype.",0

"(3) multiorgan involvement with encephalopathy, myopathy and hepatopathy; and (4) death by two months of age. The increased cerebrospinal fluid levels of Tau and neurofilament light protein suggest ongoing neurodegeneration with cortical and white matter axonal injury [24]. Intrauterine onset has to our knowledge only been described in one previous individual with a somewhat different clinical phenotype characterized by myopathy and visceral dysmotility [10]. In Alpers syndrome, which is considered to be the most severe end of the spectrum of POLG-related disease, the onset is almost always after the first months of life [6,8,9, 25-27] and only rarely at birth [7]. The p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu double mutant is considered pathogenic and is associated with a wide range of clinical phenotypes [19]. The p.His1134Tyr mutation has not been described previously, but a compound heterozygous missense exchange of the same amino acid to arginine (p.His1134Arg) has been associated with a severe phenotype with onset",0

In our patient, muscle biopsy demonstrated mitochondrial myopathy with scattered COX-deficient muscle fibers and deficiency in mtDNA-encoded proteins. Dysfunction of the respiratory chain was also demonstrated in fresh, isolated muscle mitochondria. Associated with these defects we found a reduction in mtDNA copy number to 32% of age-matched controls (i.e., below the normal range), but no large-scale deletions. These results indicate that mtDNA depletion was the cause of the mitochondrial dysfunction and COX-deficient muscle fibers. There was no possibility to analyze mtDNA levels in brain or liver, but we anticipate that mtDNA depletion was also the underlying cause of disease in these organs.",1

"dNTP concentrations. The importance of this amino acid is supported by previous work with the p.His1134Ala mutation, for which the corresponding mutation in Drosophila melanogaster caused developmental arrest and lethality at the larval stage [18]. His1134 is a strictly conserved amino acid located near the active site of the polymerase and contacts the template strand during replication [29,30]. A tyrosine at this position appears to protrude into the active site cavity and forms a new H-bond with Thr1071. This may limit the flexibility of the active site and impair Mg2+/dNTP binding, explaining the lack of polymerase activity.

"i.e. when the polymerase acts together with TWINKLE and the defect is more pronounced at physiological dNTP concentrations (Fig. 5C and D). Neither the Thr251Ile nor Pro587Leu mutations are close to the polymerase active site.

Interestingly, the molecular defects observed with p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu are similar to those previously described for mutations in POLγ B (Arg328Lys329 and Arg363Lys364Lys365), which efficiently performs DNA synthesis on ssDNA, but fails to support replisome function on a dsDNA template [1,33]. It is therefore possible that p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu does not affect the polymerase activity per se, but affects POLγ activity in the context of the replisome, potentially disturbing functional interactions with TWINKLE.",0

The inhibitory effect of p.His1134Tyr is likely due to its wild type-like DNA binding ability (Fig. 4A). This means that p.His1134Tyr can compete for the primer and thereby inhibit functional DNA synthesis (seen as the 3 kb stalled product in Fig. 5E and Supplementary Fig. 2C). Apparently, this defect is not sufficiently strong to generate a disease phenotype in the father. Conclusion",0
"In summary, we have identified a novel p.His1134Tyr mutation in POLγ A which, in trans with the p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu double mutant, causes a distinct and severe molecular phenotype. Whereas the combination of p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu with other recessive POLγ A mutations often causes adult-onset mitochondrial pathologies [34-36], the combination with p.His1134Tyr is associated with intrauterine onset of disease with clinical features at birth. When combined, p.His1134Tyr and p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu cause a very severe phenotype in vitro, which can be substantially improved in the presence of higher dNTP concentrations. Deoxynucleoside combination therapy has a positive effect on patients with TK2 deficiency and our data suggest that a similar therapeutic approach can be beneficial for patients with certain disease-causing POLγ variants [37].",0
