"Alpers disease (OMIM 203700), [1] a spongiform cerebral degenerative disease affects the cerebral cortex, the cerebellum, the basal ganglia and the brain stem. The incidence of Alpers disease is estimated between 1/100,000 and 1/250,000. The affected patients present with a developmental retardation followed by regression, intractable epilepsy, movement disorders, abnormal respiration and at times cortical atrophy and liver dysfunction [2]. Biochemical ﬁndings can disclose a dysfunction of the citric acid cycle due to reduced activity of respiratory chain enzymes attributable to mutations of the gene encoding the mitochondrial DNA polymerase enzyme (POLG)1 [3]. There are so far no biochem-",0

A 3½-year-old girl presented with acute onset of status epilepticus and somnolence. EEG activity was severely suppressed with focal spike-waves over the temporal regions. The status was initially interrupted by the use of a combination of anticonvulsant drugs but re-emerged in the following days and months and could at times only be suppressed by anesthetic agents. The girl is the only child of healthy unrelated parents. No progressive neurological diseases are known in the wider family. At the age of 30 months the girl was diagnosed with mental and,1

"motor retardation of about 8–12 months. A video taken by the local pediatrician at age 2½ years showed an ataxia with dysmetria and muscular hypotonia. Her IQ was estimated at a value of 75. At the age of 2 years she had developed simple speech, her weight and height curves never surpassed the 3rd percentile. She had no speciﬁc dysmorphic features nor increased susceptibility to infectious diseases. The child died without apparent neurodegeneration at the age of 5.5 years. An autopsy was not obtained. Neuroimaging",1
"Cranial computer tomography (CCT) on day two of the acute disease was compatible with a generalized brain edema, whereas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the CNS at the same time showed no abnormalities of either white or grey matter. A second MRI 3 months after disease onset showed mild cerebral atrophy and an 8 x 11 mm ischemic lesion in the left thalamus. Laboratory investigations",1
"Laboratory or skin examinations excluded the following diseases: sphingolipidoses, gangliosidoses, disorders of glycolysation, ceroid lipofuscinosis type 1 and 2, Lafora disease, myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red ﬁbers, and pyridoxine/pyridoxal-50 -phosphat-dependent epilepsy. Normal laboratory values were obtained for liver enzymes, coagulation parameters, lactate, lactate–pyruvate ratio, vitamin B12, homocysteine, folic acid (serum), organic acids (urine), amino acids (urine, serum) acylcarnitines (dried blood), neopterin, and biopterin (urine).

Repeated status epilepticus required invasive ventilation and at times the use of more than four anticonvulsant drugs simultaneously. Valproic acid as an anticonvulsant agent was not administered since an underlying metabolic disturbances could not be excluded and the EEG pattern with unilateral occipital rhythmic high-amplitude delta with superimposed polyspikes was suggestive of for Alpers disease [6]. Molecular examination,1
"Molecular testing revealed a compound heterozygous mutation in the POLG-1 gene on chromosome 15q25. A missense mutation in the polymerase domain in exon 16 leading to p.G848S exchange (c.2542G > A) and a missense mutation in the linker region in exon 7 leading to p.A467T exchange (c.1399G > A) was identiﬁed. The ﬁrst mutation was derived from the mother the latter from the father of the child, both being healthy. Both mutations have previously been described as compound heterozygosity in patients with Alpers disease [3]. Treatment",1
"Faced with the deteriorating clinical situation of an intractable epileptic syndrome impressing as epilepsia partialis continua, refractory to common antiepileptic drugs, we asked for parental consent to administer pharmacologic doses of folinic acid (5-formyltetrahydrofolate, Leucovorine) in order to compensate for the intracerebral folate deﬁciency. Treatment was started with a daily oral dose of 2 x 0.25 mg/kg body weight and later increased to 2 x 4 mg/kg/body weight).",1
"A remarkable clinical improvement could be observed thereafter. After 2 weeks we could start to reduce the anticonvulsant treatment from four to two drugs.

"batrin no more status epilepticus and a marked reduction of focal seizures could be witnessed. During the months of folinic acid substitution therapy the EEG remained highly pathological, although high-amplitude slow waves decreased and speciﬁc epileptic activity appeared less pronounced.",1
"On the clinical side we witnessed an improvement of communication skills of the child. Whereas before there was no interaction possible between the parents and their daughter, a prompt response of the child could be observed when the child was spoken to or touched by the parents. The girl was able to indicate physical discomfort such as a full bladder. Cortical blindness seemed much less apparent, swallowing difﬁculties were diminished. At the age of 5½ the girl passed away without an apparent deterioration.",1
"During folinic acid supplementation follow-up investigations showed a rise in CSF FR-autoantibody titers coinciding with a decrease of 5MTHF levels prompting us to increase the folinic acid doses. At disease onset IL-6 was increased 3000 times the expected value and almost approached normal values in the course of the disease, whereas IL-8 still remained elevated with an increment at 1500 times the expected value (Table 1). Discussion",0
"Although the understanding of the molecular defects of Alpers disease has increased over recent years, the exact relationship between the molecular defect and the phenotype remains very complex. Clayton described in 1982 how the 16569-bp human mitochondrial genome is replicated and repaired by DNA polymerase-c (POLG) [7]. The ﬁrst pathogenic mutations of POLG were described in 2001 in families with autosomal dominant chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia [8]. Tissue-speciﬁc mtDNA deletions were later identiﬁed as causes of deﬁciencies in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation [9].",0
Different and overlapping disease entities ranging from psychiatric disturbances to primary neurological diseases and endocrine disturbances have been associated with POLG mutation. Mutations in POLG gene account for approximately 90% of the classical phenotype of Alpers disease [10]. One in 50 people are thought to be silent heterozygote carriers of POLG mutations.,0
"Most cases with childhood onset Alpers disease are associated with at least one mutation in the linker region of the POLG gene and one in the polymerase domain. The most common disease mutation in POLG associated with Alpers disease, as in our patient, is the G-to-A mutation at nucleotide 1399 in exon 7 of POLG causing an alanine to threonine amino acid substitution at codon 467. In the Belgian population the p.A467T mutation has been observed at a frequency of 0.6% without showing clinical signs [6].",0
"In Alpers disease the p.A467T mutation is either homozygous or paired in trans with other mutations in POLG. In the case of compound heterozygosity there is a polymerase activity of only 4% comparing to the wild-type DNA [11]. It is thus the nature of the mutation in the second POLG allele in compound heterozygous patients that inﬂuences the severity and type of the disease. More prolonged disease courses with less severe symptoms have been described and seemed to be associated with a homozygous mutation [10,12].",0
"The symptomatic epilepsy in Alpers disease is usually refractory to common antiepileptic drug treatment. Epileptic status is often the terminating event. The use of valproic acid as an anticonvulsant drug has repeatedly led to a terminal hepatic failure and should be avoided [13]. The natural course of the disease is progressive with death occurring in most cases within 6–12 months after the onset of the disease. A gene dosage effect is thought to be an important determinant for age of onset, the severity, and course of the disease.",0
"We justiﬁed giving 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (calcium folinate) in the form of Leucovorin taking the following into consideration: Folic acid is a water soluble vitamin that is converted into various reduced forms involved in synthesis of purine and pyrimidine bases, methylation of genomic DNA, conversion of homocysteine to methionine, transfer of methyl-groups, and formation of the active methyl-group donor S-adenosylmethionine, used in various methylation reactions. Furthermore folates exert a direct inﬂuence on brain function through the enhanced biosynthesis of phospholipids and hence myelination.",0
The physiological plasma folate form 5MTHF is actively transferred across the blood–brain barrier by a folate receptor mediated endocytotic process in choroid epithelial cells and reaches 2–4-fold higher concentration in the spinal ﬂuid as compared to serum.,0
"A balanced diet usually provides sufﬁcient quantities of folate to the CNS. However, the presence of folate receptor autoantibodies, oxidative stress and secondary inﬂammatory responses are able to block folate transfer across the choroid plexus to the CNS. Such primary and secondary forms of cerebral folate deﬁciency (CFD) with an encephalopathic symptomatology have extensively been described in the infantile-onset CFD syndrome [14], mitochondrial encephalopathies [15], Kearns-Sayre syndrome [16], Rett syndrome [17,18], and Aicardi-Goutières syndrome [19]. The use of antifolate drugs in rare inborn errors of metabolism like deﬁciency of dihydropteridine reductase, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, aromatic aminoacid decarboxylase and 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase should be excluded [14].",0
"The low CSF levels of 5MTHF in our patient can be explained by blocked transport across the blood–brain barrier due to the presence of FR autoantibodies as well as by increased utilization and catabolism of 5MTHF due to oxidative stress [16]. Another explanation may be a defective transport due to ATP depletion in the choroid plexus, as seen in Kearns-Sayre syndrome.",0
"Of interest are the relative high concentrations of neurotransmitter metabolites 5HIAA, HVA, and 3OMD in CSF. Both serotonin and catecholamines metabolism are intimately tied to both mitochondria and inﬂammation. An inﬂammatory event with IFN-c stimulation is known to lead to both increased tryptophan degra- dation (via indoleamine dioxygenase) and neopterin production (via GTP cyclohydrolase I) [20].",0
"The substitution with high doses of folinic acid will increase 5MTHF plasma concentrations even in the presence of blocking FR autoantibodies facilitating thereby an increased uptake of 5MTHF into the CSF compartment via the folate carrier. To treat the cerebral folate deﬁciency we have chosen an initial oral dose of 2 x 0.25 mg/kg body weight Leucovorine and later adapted the dose to reach age speciﬁc levels of CSF 5MTHF. We refrained from further augmenting the dose, since it is known that high folic acid doses can decrease blood levels of anticonvulsant drugs such as Phenobarbital and thereby potentially interfere with seizure control [21]. The medication was well tolerated and followed by a marked improvement of the child, though high CSF IL-8 levels reminded of the persisting pro-inﬂammatory process.",0
"Considering the possible mechanism of the observed effects, we speculate that repletion of folates within the CNS could lead to a partial repair of previously deranged folate-dependant pathways and mitochondrial dysfunction. To our knowledge in disorders of mtDNA deletions the role of folinic acid substitution has not been evaluated. At the moment we do not know to what extent the production of folate receptor autoantibodies in Alpers disease contribute to its pathophysiology, whether it represents a consistent ﬁnding or it is merely an epiphenomenon of the cerebral inﬂammatory response.",0
