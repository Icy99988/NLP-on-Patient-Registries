"Polymerase gamma (POLG) is a nuclear gene that encodes mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (pol c). It is the only polymerase for mitochondrial DNA(mtDNA) replication and repair [1]. Dysfunction of pol c results in impaired integrity of mtDNA, including to depletion or deletion, eventually leading to diminution of mitochondrial energy with disorders of oxidative phosphorylation [2]. The spectrum of phenotypes caused by the mutation of POLG is broad, which include Alpers syndrome, progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), limb myopathy, parkinsonism, epilepsy and other multi-systemic features [3]. The first 2 cases of parkinsonism with POLG mutation were reported in 2004, by Michelangelo Mancuso [4]. Here, we report another case of a female patient carrying a novel compound heterozygotic missense mutation in POLG.",1
Case presentation The 29 year-old Chinese female patient developed right upper limb mixed rest and postural tremor at,1
"the age of 16. The tremor gradually progressed to left upper limb, lower extremities and the head. Two years later, she showed signs of parkinsonism including bradykinesia and shuffling gait. Treatment with benserazide/levodopa 25/100 mg bid and benzhexol hydrochloride 2 mg tid significantly improved tremor and bradykinesia, however, soon accompanied with severe peak-dose dyskinesia. With time the patient showed end-of-dose deterioration effect, and selfadjusted benserazide/levodopa’s dose to 12.5/50 mg q2h (about 150/600 mg per day) which helped to relieve the fluctuation. At 23 years of age, the patient developed signs of slowly progressive bilateral ptosis, and a year later, her symptoms significantly aggravated, with frequent falls because of dyskinesia and postural instability, along with development of diplopia, dysarthria and dysphagia. The patient also reported presence of mild muscles weakness and exercise intolerance conditions.",1
"Her family history was unremarkable. No familial history of consanguineous marriage was found.

"Neurological examination revealed cognitive deficits, with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score of 16/30 (decline in calculation and delayed recall). Hypophonia, hypomimia, bilateral blepharoptosis and external ophthalmoplegia with diplopia were found. Presence of hypopsia (Vision acuity: right 0.05, left counting fingers/2 centimeters), mild symmetrical proximal muscle weakness (Medical Research Council grade 4/5), with diminished deep tendon reflexes was found. Presence of rest tremor in all limbs, slowing and amplitude decrements during finger tapping and hand pronation-supination movements, and postural instability were found. Reduced bilateral arm swing during walking could be seen. The patient had a positive response to levodopa accompanied by peak-dose dyskinesia in limbs and trunk.",1
Fundoscopy revealed bilateral optic atrophy. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed retinal nerve fiber layer thickness loss. Brain MRI displayed diffuse cortical atrophy. Reduced striatal 11 C-b-CFT uptake was seen in the bilateral putamen and caudate on DaT scan. FDG-PET scan showed hypometabolism in parietal and occipital lobe. Muscle biopsy specimen obtained from the biceps brachii muscle revealed specific changes with ragged red fibers (Figure 1).,1
"Total DNA was extracted by using DNA extraction kit (made by Qiagen, DNeasy Blood &Tissue Kit) from blood. Specific DNA probes were customized according to NCBI. Whole exons (including nuclear genomes and mitochondrial DNA) were sequenced by Southern blot and PCR. No mutations were found in any of the recessive genes associated with early-onset Parkinson’s disease, such as pakin, PINK1, DJ-1. While a novel heterozygous c.2693T > C (p.I898T) (Figure 2) mutation was found in exon17 of POLG. The patient’s mother also carried the same heterozygous mutation but her father was wild type. Another heterozygous point",1
"Figure 2. c.2693T > C (p.I898T) and c.2993C > T (p.S998L). mutation found was c.2993C > T (p.S998L) in exon19 of POLG which has been reported previously [5] (Figure 2). Also, the same mutation was verified in her father. Discussion",1
"Parkinsonism features have been reported as a late complication of POLG-associated dominant PEO [4, 6–9]. While our patient developed parkinsonism symptoms about 5 years prior to PEO. In addition, this patient suffered from severely decreased visual acuity, loss in retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and optic atrophy, which is extremely rare in cases with POLG mutation. Only one case reported by Margherita Milone [10] presented with optic atrophy carried a splice-site mutation in intron 18 of POLG (c.3104 þ 3A > T), accompanied with ptosis, ophthalmoparesis and dysphagia. However, the major difference from our case was the lack of parkinsonism.",1
"The mutation c.2993C > T (p.S998L) has been described previously, besides, in that case the patient was reported to have two heterozygous nucleotide substitutions: c.2993C > T (p.998S > L) and c.3550G > C (p.1184D > H). The dominant features of that patient were bilateral ptosis, external ophthalmoplegia and progressive encephalopathy. Our patient on the other hand carried another novel mutation c.2693T > C (p.I898T) INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE 321",0
"and her dominant symptoms were parkinsonism, external ophthalmoplegia, optic atrophy, which are obviously different from the patient reported before. Conclusion We reported a patient carrying a novel compound heterozygotic missense mutation in POLG(c.2993C > T (p.998S > L) and c.2693T > C (p.I898T)). And c.2693T > C (p.I898T) to our knowledge has never been reported before. This finding of ours has broadened the spectrum of phenotype caused by the mutation of POLG1.
