"MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopa­ thy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes) syn­ drome is a characteristic mitochondrial disorder caused by point mutations in the mitochondrial ge­ nome (mtDNA).1 In addition to primary mtDNA defects, mutations in nuclear genes essential for mtDNA maintenance are emerging as important causes of mitochondrial disease leading to second­ ary mtDNA changes including mtDNA depletion and multiple mtDNA deletions. Of particular inter­ est are mutations in the mtDNA polymerase ')' (POLGl) gene, which are associated with a pheno­ typic spectrum ranging from Alpers syndrome to re­ cessive ataxia and late-onset progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO).2•5 We describe a patient with strokelike episodes typical of MELAS due to mutation of POLGl.",0
"Case history. A 28-year-old man was admitted to hospital at age 23 years because of acute onset of head jerking to the left side and vomiting, preceded by several days of visual scintillations and right­ sided headache. He had been well until 2 years pre­ viously when it was noted that he had problems with coordination and concentration. Neurologic examination revealed left homonymous hemi­ anopia, areflexia, and sensory ataxia. A few hours after admission, he developed left-sided focal sei­ zures with secondary generalization leading to sta­ tus epilepticus, which was successfully treated with clonazepam and valproate. Cognitive deficits in memory and attention were noted, and there was a degree of motor apraxia. Over the past 5 years, there have been no further strokelike-episodes or seizures. Neurologic examination reveals left-sided homonymous hemianopia, a mild cognitive deficit, areflexia, and sensory ataxia but no ophthalmople­ gia. There is no family history of note.",1

"ments of blood lactate, liver enzymes, and creatine kinase, were unremarkable. Examination of CSF showed a mild increase in protein (62.1 mg/dL, nor­ mal <50 mg/dL) and elevated lactate (3.4 mmol/L, normal <2.1 mmol/L). Brain MRI revealed a right­ sided occipital lesion (figure, A). EEG showed focal sharp waves in the right occipital region. Neuro­ physiology and sural nerve biopsy revealed a sen­ sory axonal peripheral neuropathy. Examination of a muscle biopsy specimen demonstrated subsar­ colemmal accumulation of mitochondria in some fi­ bers, with enzyme histochemistry revealing 5% cytochrome c oxidase (COX)-deficient fibers but no strongly succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-posi-",1
"tive vessels (figure, B). Respiratory chain complex activities were normal in muscle. The 3243A>G, 3271T>C and 8344A>G mtDNA mutations were not detected in muscle, and Southern blot analysis did not reveal evidence of mtDNA rearrangements. Long-range PCR, how­ ever, amplified several smaller bands compatible with multiple mtDNA deletions, which was con­ firmed by real-time PCR analysis of clonally expanded mtDNA deletions in individual cells (figure, C).6",1
"Sequencing of the ANTl and PEOl genes re­ vealed no mutations, but analysis of POLGl re­ vealed two reported heterozygous missense mutations in compound c.l880G>A in exon 10 pre­ dicting R627Q and c.2542G>A in exon 16 predict­ ing G848S. Sequencing of parental samples confirmed recessive inheritance of the mutated al­ leles (figure E-1 on the Neurology Web site at www.neurology.org).",1
"Discussion. Our patient's clinical presentation (strokelike episode with occipital localization, headache, and seizures) and laboratory investiga­ tions (elevated CSF lactate, ragged-red fibers) fulfill the diagnostic criteria for MELAS. 1 The presence of COX-deficient fibers (although unusual in MELAS) and the absence of typical mtDNA point mutations prompted further investigations. Both long-range PCR and real-time PCR analyses detected multiple mtDNA deletions, confirming that low levels of multiple mtDNA deletions may sometimes remain undetected by Southern blot analysis3•4",1
"Sequencing of the POLGl gene identified com­ pound heterozygous mutations, consistent with the negative family history and indicative of autosomal recessive inheritance. Both mutations have been re­ ported previously as recessive mutations, although not together; the R627Q mutation has been docu­ mented in patients with PEO and sensory ataxia, and Alpers syndrome, whereas the G848S mutation has been reported in patients with either PEO or Alpers syndrome (http://dir-apps.niehs.nih.gov/polg/).",0
"Although POLGl mutations are widely de­ scribed in patients with encephalopathy, typical strokelike episodes are unusual, although there is a report of an ataxic patient with the A467T mutation whose 17-year-old sister had acute encephalopathy and seizures followed by cortical blindness and stu­ por, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, and sudden death.3 In other patients with POLGl mutations, cerebral lesions in the occipital lobes similar to MELAS were observed, but strokelike-episodes were not report­ ed.4•5 Many of these patients presented with epilepsy and headache typically observed during strokelike",0

Schwenger, MD 1742 o�---- COX-deficient muscle fibers episodes, but their lesions were small compared with the occipital hyperintensity seen in our patient. The majority of patients presenting with liver fail­ ure did so following valproate treatment of status epilepticus, and even though our patient was treated successfully with valproate without precipitating liver failure, valproate administration should be avoided in patients with POLGl mutations.",0
"In addition to the strokelike episode, our patient had a sensory neuropathy but no evidence of ptosis or PEO. Neuropathy with sensory ataxia is typically observed in patients with POLGl mutations3•5 and, al­ though not a characteristic feature of MELAS, a signif­ icant proportion of patients with the 3243A>G mutation have clinical signs of neuropathy.7",1
"In conclusion, our case highlights the complexity of the relationship between genotype and phenotype in mitochondrial disorders and broadens the strik­ ing phenotypic variability of POLGl mutations that now must also include MELAS, a classic mitochon­ drial syndrome.

"Case report. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) re­ ceptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) is an autosomally dominant inherited disorder resulting from mutations within the TNF receptor super fam­ ily lA gene (TNFRSFlA), which impair cleavage of p55 TNF receptors (TNFRl), decrease soluble TNFRl serum levels, and affect intracellular traf­ ficking of mutant proteins. 1 The associated unop­ posed TNFa signaling confers self-limited autoinflammation and may promote amyloidosis. Here, we provide clinical and histologic evidence that TRAPS may affect the CNS and has to be in­ cluded in the spectrum of autoimmune inflamma­ tory CNS disorders.",0

"Our patient was diagnosed with a C55A muta­ tion in exon 3 of the TNFRSFlA gene and had expe­ rienced recurrent attacks of fever, myalgias, arthralgias, and painful migratory rashes since childhood. At age 38 he developed brainstem and cerebellar symptoms from an extensively contrast­ enhancing lesion in the left cerebellar peduncle; acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) or lymphoma was considered.2 However, brain biopsy revealed a T-cell-predominated inflammatory infil­ trate without evidence of demyelination (figure, A through D). Moreover, treatment with several courses of methylprednisolone was only transiently effective, and cranial MRI revealed striking persis­ tence of contrast enhancement in the left infratento· rial lesion 1 year after disease onset (figure, E and F). CSF analysis showed a mild lymphocytic pleocy­ tosis of 7 cells/ µ,L and repeatedly negative oligo-",0
