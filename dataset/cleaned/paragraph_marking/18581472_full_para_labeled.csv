Alexander Disease Causing Hereditary Late-Onset Ataxia with Only Minimal White,0
Matter Changes: A Report of Two Sibs,0
Video,0
"Classic Alexander disease refers to a rare neurodegenerative leukodystrophy, typically manifesting in early childhood with megaloencephaly, seizures, spasticity, and psychomotor regression. Until recently, its diagnosis was based on distinctive MRI features, such as white matter lesions that predominantly affect the frontotemporal and periventricular regions. The ﬁnding of causative mutations in the GFAP gene has enabled diagnostic conﬁrmation by mutation analysis. This has also lead to the identiﬁcation of atypical and late-onset cases, with a highly variable spectrum of clinical and imaging abnormalities.",0
"We report a case of an adult-onset, mutation proven Alexander disease characterized by cerebellar and sensory ataxia, the absence of palatal tremor, and very mild white matter changes.1,2",0
"This 61-year-old man presented at the age of 50 years with slowly progressive gait difﬁculties. His past medical history revealed the onset of static but marked forward ﬂexion of the trunk in his ﬁrst decade, but without any motor abnormalities until recently. His sister had been diagnosed with progressive cerebellar ataxia; there were no other affected relatives.",0
"Neurological examination (see video) revealed a normal mental status; jerky pursuit, and dysmetric saccades; mild cerebellar dysarthria; mild ataxia of the trunk and extremities that increased upon eye closure; a broad-based, ataxic gait; cervical kyphosis and thoracic scoliosis with ﬂexion contractures of the hips and knees; positive Romberg’s sign; disturbed vibration sense in the lower limbs; slightly diminished tendon reﬂexes in the lower extremities with normal plantar responses.",0
"We screened for several of the genetic ataxias, but no mutations were detected in the SCA1/2/3/6/7/14 genes or in the genes responsible for Friedreich’s ataxia and dentatorubro-pallido-luysian atrophy. Electromyography showed no signs of neuropathy or myopathy. SSEP was not performed. MRI demonstrated subtle white matter lesions anteriorly in both temporal lobes, as well as mild atrophy of the cerebellum, brainstem and cervical spinal cord on standard MRI imaging (Fig. 1A–C).",0

"The records of the affected sister, who died at the age of 64, mentioned horizontal nystagmus, cerebellar dysarthria, limb ataxia, and progressive gait difﬁculties. In addition, the presence of palatal myoclonus was noted once. While the dysarthria was said to exist from an early age, the gait difﬁculties arose at the age of 30. Brain imaging (at age 58 years) showed cerebellar and marked bulbomedullar atrophy as well as white matter lesions in the periventricular region, corpus callosum, and right medial cerebellar peduncle (Fig. 1D–F).",0
"As these combined clinical and imaging features were suggestive of Alexander disease, we sequenced the GFAP gene, and found a novel heterozygous c.692T > A missense mutation in exon 4, predicting a p.Leu231His amino acid change; this mutation was not encountered in 210 control chromosomes.",0
"Several cases of adult-onset Alexander disease have been reported, mostly with an onset in the third or fourth decade of life. Phenotypic heterogeneity is evident from the variable presence of bulbar symptoms, cerebellar signs, palatal tremor, spastic paresis, and autonomic dysfunction.",0
"The index patient reported here displays a rather unique phenotype of adult-onset Alexander disease. First, his age at onset was 50 years, which is one of the latest ever reported.3 Second, his clinical presentation was dominated by the combined presence of slowly progressive cerebellar and sensory ataxia, in the absence of palatal tremor. The kyphoscoliosis and his knee-bent posture are very likely related to his Alexander disease, as these features have been observed previously.4–13 Yet, the interval to the onset of ataxia in our case is remarkable. Third, neuroimaging in our patient revealed cerebellar, brainstem, and spinal cord atrophy—all previously reported imaging features of Alexander disease— but the white matter changes were extremely subtle, involving a minor portion of the anterior poles of both temporal lobes only. MRI abnormalities in adult-onset Alexander disease are heterogeneous, but the white matter changes are generally less extensive compared with the classic early-onset disease.17",0
"The give-away in this case was the presence of a PAPT syndrome in the patient’s sister. The combination of cerebellar ataxia and palatal tremor is relatively common in adultonset Alexander disease (43%).4,9–12,14 This clinical constellation is presently referred to as PAPT (progressive ataxia and palatal tremor), used to indicate a subgroup of the symptomatic palatal tremor in which neurodegenerative diseases are involved. In case of a familial PAPT, the differential diagnosis is quite limited and, in addition to Alexander disease, also includes SCA20 and perhaps other forms of degenerative cerebellar ataxias.15,16",0
"In conclusion, we report two sibs with late-onset ataxia due to Alexander disease caused by a novel GFAP mutation. Alexander disease should thus be considered in the differential diagnosis of otherwise unexplained hereditary late-onset",0

Antihistamine-Associated Myoclonus: A Case Report,0
"Myoclonus is a clinical sign deﬁned as sudden, brief, shocklike, involuntary movements caused by muscular contractions (positive myoclonus) or inhibitions (negative myoclonus, asterixis). Most causes of myoclonus are symptomatic and include posthypoxia, toxic-metabolic disorders, and neurodegenerative disorders.1 Various drugs, including neuroleptics, anticonvulsants, and cardiac medications, can cause myoclonus,1,2 but antihistamine-associated myoclonus is extremely rare.2,3 Here, we report a case of transient myoclonus triggered by an antihistamine, oxatomide.",0
"An 85-year-old man taking amlodipine (5 mg/day), candesartan (8 mg/day), arotinolol (20 mg/day), and furosemide (20 mg/day) for hypertension, and allopurinol (200 mg/day) for hyperuricemia, developed an involuntary movement in his right hand. It progressed over his upper limbs and face within several hours, and he was referred to our hospital. On physical examination, he was afebrile without abnormality, except for systolic hypertension (170/80 mm Hg). The mini-mental status test revealed cognitive impairment (score 20). At rest there was myoclonus in the patient’s face, tongue, jaw, neck, and upper limbs, predominantly on the left. There was no palatal tremor. An electrophysiological study revealed 4-Hz rhythmic myoclonic discharges in the left arm muscles with synchronized ocular movement that increased with eyelid closure (see Fig. 1), and suggested that the myoclonus was persistent and time-locked in all locations (generalized myo-",0

"clonus). Limb myoclonus was exaggerated when the patient extended his upper limbs, but it was not induced by external sensory stimuli. The involuntary movements were not suppressed by mental stress or by alternate pronation and supination of the forearm to an external rhythm. Asterixis was evident when the patient’s upper limbs were extended and his wrists dorsiﬂexed, and it caused the lapse in posture between the positive myoclonic jerks. He was unable to maintain his tongue in the protruded position owing to asterixis of the tongue, and he had difﬁculty speaking. Neurological examination was otherwise normal. Laboratory examination revealed a mild elevation of urea nitrogen (25 mg/dL) and aspartate aminotransferase (40 IU/L), but the plasma ammonia concentration and thyroid function were normal. Chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly, and cardiac ultrasonography showed left ventricular hypertrophy and mild mitral regurgitation. The plasma brain natriuretic peptide concentration was 189.0 pg/mL. Abdominal sonography and computed tomography revealed no abnormality, and there was no portalsystemic shunt. Cerebrospinal ﬂuid analysis was normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed diffuse cerebral atrophy, which was consistent with Alzheimer’s disease, and an old ischemic lesion in the right cerebellum. Electroencephalography showed a 9-Hz alpha background rhythm without epileptiform activity. The involuntary movements disappeared immediately after the intravenous administration of 10 mg diazepam.",0

"clonus, but it disappeared within several hours after oral administration of 0.5 mg clonazepam. All of the patient’s medications were reviewed again. The ﬁrst myoclonus occurred after 18 days’ use of oxatomide (120 mg/day), and the second occurred after 8 days’ use of oxatomide (120 mg/day) and epinastine (20 mg/day) for chronic prurigo. The myoclonus has not recurred since the patient stopped the antihistamines.",0
"Our patient ﬁrst presented with acute occurrences of both generalized myoclonus and asterixis, predominantly in the face, neck, and upper limbs. The involuntary movements disappeared immediately after benzodiazepine treatment, but he experienced a recurrence. These clinical features are similar to the ‘‘transient myoclonic state with asterixis’’ previously reported by Hashimoto et al.4 The cause of that state is unclear, although aging, chronic diseases, and viral infection could contribute. However, in our patient, the temporal relationship between myoclonus and the antihistamine medication history suggests that oxatomide triggered the movement disorder. Oxatomide, a second-generation antihistamine, is used to treat allergic diseases in Europe and Japan. Its pharmacologic actions include histamine H1-receptor antagonism and suppression of the production and release of chemical mediators, as well as anti-cholinergic and anti-serotonin actions.5 Antihistamines can both stimulate and depress the central nervous system (CNS), but second-generation drugs do not appreciably cross the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, there are few reports of abnormal involuntary movements associated with antihistamines. However, Rajput et al. recently reported a pediatric case of dystonia induced by a second-generation antihistamine (cetirizine), possibly because of dopamine receptor blockade by the drug metabolite.6 Oxatomide can also cause dystonia.7 However, to our knowledge, there is only one report of antihistamine-induced myo-",0

"clonus, in that case caused by abusive overuse of a ﬁrst-generation antihistamine (tripelennamine).3 It remains unclear why oxatomide triggered myoclonus in our patient. We could not determine the plasma concentration of oxatomide when he was suffering from the myoclonus. However, cardiac or renal dysfunction might raise the drug concentration to a toxic level in the CNS, and the drug might affect the serotonergic system to cause myoclonus, although the serotonin hypothesis of myoclonus remains controversial.8 On the other hand, our patient was demented and being treated with antihypertensive agents. Dementia can lower the threshold for myoclonus or can be a cause of myoclonus in and of itself.1 Furthermore, cardiac medications can also cause myoclonus.1 Therefore, the minor toxic-metabolic disturbance caused by antihistamine use might have led our elderly, myoclonusprone patient into a transient myoclonic state. This is the ﬁrst report of myoclonus triggered by a therapeutic dose of antihistamines. Clinicians should recognize that antihistamines could trigger this benign but dramatic CNS side effect.",0

Do Parkinson’s Disease and Dementia with Lewy Bodies Differ by Route of Environmental Precipitant?,0
"Braak and colleagues followed their groundbreaking staging classiﬁcation for the brain neuropathology of Alzheimer’s disease with the more recent one for sporadic Parkinson’s disease (PD).1 Their new PD staging system has revolutionized thinking about the topographic sequence of neuropathological changes as the illness progresses, generally in a caudal-rostral direction from lower brainstem to neocortex.",0

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR	1617,0
"One of the most important of Braak et al.’s observations may be that olfactory structures are one of the ﬁrst sites of neuropathology in the central nervous system (CNS).2 Coupled with emerging evidence that characteristic synucleinopathic changes can be seen in the peripheral autonomic nervous system (including the gastrointestinal tract) even before CNS involvement,3–6 a critical implication of these ﬁndings is that the nose and mouth become suspect as portals of entry for an inciting pathogenic agent.",0
"After nasal entry, transneuronal transmission along olfactory pathways is a potential route to the brain. It has been shown, for example, that inhaled ultraﬁne heavy metal particles, which might come from occupational exposures, can pass through the nasal mucosa and be transynaptically transported to deeper brain regions.7 Once a pathogenic agent passes through the gastrointestinal mucosa after oral entry, the pathway via the enteric autonomic nervous system to the vagus nerve and the vagal nuclei in the lower brainstem (also one of the early loci of PD pathology in the CNS1,2) would be open. Thus, environmental factors in the air, water, and food look to be integrally involved in the initial phases of the illness. Potential environmental agents that have been suggested include agricultural pesticides and herbicides reviewed in,8,9 heavy metals,7 viruses,10 and prions.11 Genetic factors might inﬂuence individual susceptibility or response to the offending agents.",0
"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) differs from PD by diffuse synucleinopathic degeneration, involving cortex and brainstem, at onset rather than the initial focal olfactory and lower brainstem pathology of PD.12 It has been debated whether PD and DLB are variants of the same disease or represent distinct entities.13 Based on the differences in their neuropathologic temporal proﬁle, I hypothesize that there is an etiological difference that is primarily due to the route of exposure to inciting environmental agents. Under this view, PD results from respiratory (airborne) or gastrointestinal (water/foodborne) exposure while DLB develops following systemic (bloodborne) exposure. Type of toxicant and level of exposure might determine whether signiﬁcant concentrations are achieved in the circulation. Underlying genetic factors might also contribute to which route(s) and levels of exposure result in toxicity. The hypothesis is testable by comparing PD and DLB patients for routes, types, and magnitudes of environmental exposures.",0

Dystonia Associated with Hyperintense Basal Ganglia Lesions on T1-Weighted Brain MRI,0
"A 43-year-old man presented with cardiac arrest due to an anaphylactic shock after ﬂuorescein application for retinal angiography. After cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the patient could be weaned from tracheal respiration 2 days later. The initial neurological examination revealed generalized hypokinesia, rigidity of extremities, and severe axial dystonia with anterocollis and increased oromandibular tone with almost incapability to open the mouth (Fig. 1A). A mild reduction of hypokinesia occurred due to medication of amantadine and levodopa. The oromandibular dystonia improved considerably under repetitive local injections of botulinum toxin type A, and the patient is able to eat and speak without assistance. The clinical symptoms are stable since the initial attack over a period of 3.5 years now (see Fig. 1A and video for current clinical state).",0

"Similar T1-weighted MRI hyperintensities have been described previously in several patients with chorea after nonketotic hyperglycemia.1,2 and rarely in patients with hypoglycaemic coma3 or chronic hepatic encephalopathy.4 In these cases, postischemic petechial hemorrhage was suspected as a possible mechanism, although sporadic postmortem pathological studies have reported selective neuronal loss, gliosis, and reactive astrocytosis as common ﬁndings.5,6 Fujioka et al. reported delayed ischemic hyperintensity on T1-weighted MRI in the striatum of rats 7 days after brief focal ischemia.7 Histological preparation of the animal brains showed selective neuronal death and proliferation of reactive astrocytes and microglia without infarct, hemorrhage, lipid accumulation, or apparent calciﬁcation.",0
"Together, the reasons for the initial T1-hyperintensities remain elusive. Theoretically, besides intracellular methemoglobin in hemorrhagic tissue and calciﬁcations, paramagnetic compounds including metal ions (e.g., iron, manganese and copper), molecular oxygen, or free radicals could lead to these",0

Successful Treatment of the Meige Syndrome with Oral Zolpidem Monotherapy,0
"Zolpidem is an imidazopyridine agonist with a high afﬁnity for the benzodiazepine a1 subunit site.1 It has been reported that this drug improves motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson’s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and Xlinked dystonia-Parkinsonism syndrome.2–5 Recently, zolpidem has been shown to be effective in the treatment of blepharospasm and the Meige syndrome in combination with botulinum toxin A.6",0
"Here, we report a patient with Meige syndrome, nonresponsive to botulinum toxin A, but successfully treated with oral zolpidem administration.",0
"A 59-year-old man, previously healthy, presented with disabling blepharospasm, visual difﬁculty, and facial grimacing that began 6 months before presentation. Before four years, he reported an abnormal feeling of tension in the lower eyelid and subsequently developed involuntary excessive blinking. The dystonic symptoms were usually provoked by speaking or chewing. However, they continued at rest and were relieved by placing a pencil between his teeth. In addition, the patient reported that the symptoms were improved after taking oral zolpidem, prescribed for insomnia by his primary physician; he took this medication a half-hour before going to sleep. The patient had been treated with 50 mg quetiapine, 8 mg trihexiphenidyl, and 40 mg baclofen without any beneﬁt. In addition, botulinum toxin A treatment was attempted (Botox 40 units, injection in eight sites of the orbicularis oculi muscle and four sites of the orbicularis oris muscle), but this had little effect. The patient reported no history of head trauma, peripheral traumatic or surgical incidents, or neurological diseases. There was",0

no exposure to neuroleptic medications. There was no family history of movement disorders.,0
"The neurological examination was normal except for blepharospasm and oromandibular dystonia appearing synchronously. These movements were partially relieved by holding a pencil between the teeth (Segment 1). Neuropsychological testing for memory and frontal lobe functions was within normal limits. The evaluations including magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, electroencephalogram, serum chemistries, a complete blood count, serum ceruloplasmin, thyroid function tests, and genetic testing for the DYT1 mutation in the torsion A gene were normal. The dental and ophthalmology examinations were also normal.",0
"We evaluated whether oral zolpidem treatment could improve the blepharospasm and oromandibular dystonia. These symptoms completely resolved within 1 hour after taking this medicine, and the patient was symptom-free for 4 hours without somnolence (Segment 2). A long-acting zolpidem tartrate (12.5 mg four times per day) has been prescribed, and this patient remains symptom free during the daytime.",0
"Meige syndrome is a form of cranial dystonia; it affects the cranial muscles and is characterized by involuntary blinking and chin thrusting.7 This syndrome is considered a variant of idiopathic torsion dystonia. Although botulinum toxin injections are useful for the treatment of blepharospasm as well as facial and oromandibular dystonia, the symptoms are usually refractory or only partially relieved with this medication.8",0
"Zolpidem completely abolished the symptoms associated with the Meige syndrome in our patient without causing somnolence. The location of the highest density of zolpidembinding receptors is in the ventral globus pallidus, the substantia nigra pars reticulate, and the subthalamic nucleus.9,10 Recently, zolpidem in the subthalamic nucleus was shown to enhance g-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptormediated inhibitory synaptic currents and therefore appears to modulate motor behavior in awake animals11; these results suggested that zolpidem may inhibit the excitability of subthalamic neurons and therefore compensate for the excessive inhibition of basal ganglia targets in Parkinsonism, leading to the improvement of symptoms in Parkinson’s disease. However, because other basal ganglia nuclei also express zolpidem-binding sites, zolpidem may also exert electrophysiological effects on these other nuclei.12 In addition, other mechanisms may be involved in attenuating dyskinetic symptoms. For example, GABAergic drugs can be effective in ameliorating experimental orofaical dyskinesia by reinforcing the involvement GABAergic hypofunction,13 and the neuroprotective and antioxidant properties of zolpidem in vivo and in vitro may contribute to the modulation of dyskinesia.14",0
"Although the exact mechanism of binding to these sites is unknown, zolpidem might reverse the pathophysiological changes in the subthalamic nucleus, and therefore the whole basal ganglia circuit. In addition to the direct effects on the basal ganglia, we cannot rule out the possibility that the anxiolytic inﬂuence of zolpidem may contribute to its beneﬁcial effects on dystonia.",0
"In conclusion, oral zolpidem may be a useful pharmacologic alternative for patients with Meige syndrome who do not respond to botulinum toxin treatment. However, special precautions are necessary for long-term management with this drug because of the risk of zolpidem abuse, especially in patients with a previous history of substance abuse.15",0

Torsional Nystagmus Induced by Subthalamic Nucleus Stimulation,0
"Chronic bilateral stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is effective in severe Parkinson’s disease (PD).1 However, a few side effects, especially oculomotor manifestations have been reported.2 Understanding their mechanism may help to better deﬁne functional anatomy of this region.",0
"A 66-year-old woman was treated by bilateral STN stimulation for PD. A 40% decrease of the Uniﬁed Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor score followed STN stimulation alone with the following parameters: left, contact 2: 3.5 V/60 l second/160 Hz; right, contact 7: 3.5 V/90 l second/160 Hz.",0
"During parameters setting, she complained of vertigo, nauseas, and oscillopsia for high voltages of stimulation (‡3.5 V) on both sides, especially on contacts 1 (left) and 6 (right), at high intensity (respectively, 4.5 V and 3.5 V). We noticed a torsional nystagmus (TN) beating on the side opposite to the stimulation (the direction is given by the upper pole of the eye, relative to patient’s) (Table 1). This completely disappeared when the parameters of stimulation were decreased and was reproducible over time. End-of-surgery stereotactic coordinates of each contact were used to locate them within a 3D deformable atlas of the basal ganglia (see Fig. 1).3 This conﬁrmed the unusual medial trajectories of electrodes already suspected on the brain MRI.",0
"Under chronic stimulation parameters, we observed a right sided head tilt and a right skew deviation (i.e. hypotropic right eye). Eye motility was normal and there was no nystagmus. Subjective visual vertical (SVV) was tilted to the right (13.48), fundi disclosed bilateral right sided ocular torsion. This was consistent with a right sided ocular tilt reaction (OTR). Eye movement recording practiced after the patient gave her written consent, showed hypometric upward saccades, normal horizontal vestibulo ocular reﬂex (VOR), and smooth pursuit (Table 2).",0
"With right stimulation on contact 6 (3.5 V), a counterclockwise TN was found. Except for lower gain of VOR, eye movements were not modiﬁed (Table 2). Vertical saccades could not be correctly recorded. The skew deviation increased. SVV slightly decreased (12.048).",0
"With left stimulation on contact 1 (4.5 V), we noticed a clockwise TN. Velocities of downward saccades, downward smooth pursuit gain, and horizontal pendular VOR gain decreased (Table 2). The right sided skew deviation decreased, SVV normalized (10.48).",0
"Previously reported oculomotor side effects of STN stimulation consisted of eyelid apraxia, binocular diplopia, myosis, mydriasis, and contraversive eye deviation.1,2,4–14 TN has been observed during periaqueductal gray matter,15 but not during STN stimulation.",0
"STN is involved in saccades and smooth pursuit in primates and humans16–23 and its stimulation could explain some ocular motor side effects such as contraversive eye deviation.10 However, it is unlikely that STN could have induced the TN as it was not observed at low intensity of stimulation",0

"Two prenuclear midbrain structures adjacent to the STN could be implicated in the TN: the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fascicle (riMLF) and the interstitial nucleus of Cajal (iC). The riMLF is the immediate premotor structure for the generation of torsional and vertical saccades.25 On each side, riMLF would encode signals for both upward and downward, but only for ipsitorsional saccades.26 The iC is involved in the control of vertical and ipsilateral torsional VOR and velocity to position integrator.25 In human, lesions of riMLF alone or iC-combined essentially induce a contralesional TN with slowing of vertical saccades, contralesional torsional deviations during saccades and absent quick phases during ipsidirectional head rotations in roll.26–29 Unilateral iC lesion leads to ipsilesional TN and unilateral stimulation of the iC evokes ipsilateral eye torsion and head tilt in nonhuman.30,31 In humans, iC lesion sparing riMLF may induce ipsilesional TN28 and contraversive32,33 or ipsiversive28 ocular tilt reaction.",0
"Here, the dysfunction of vertical saccades is consistent with an inhibition of the riMLF but modulation of OTR can also suggest a stimulation of the iC. Whether this is explained by nucleus or afferent/efferent ﬁbers is not clear either. To clarify this point, it could be helpful to simulate the current density around the stimulation area.34",0
"According to the close relationship of iC, riMLF, and stimulation contacts, the contralateral TN reported here could be due to an activation of the iC or an inhibition of the riMLF or both, either due to a direct nucleus or an indirect in/out connecting pathways modulation.",0

Palatal Tremor and Facial Dyskinesia in a Patient with POLG1 Mutation,1
"Recently, a progressive ataxic syndrome (MSCAE) caused by zA467T and W748S POLG1 mutations was reported.1–4 The nuclear gene, POLG1 encodes the catalytic subunit of the mitochondrial DNA dependent polymerase, polymerase g5. The catalytic subunit comprises three domains, a polymerase and 30-50 exonuclease domain and an intervening linker region. Over 70 mutations have been reported in the catalytic subunit with both dominant and recessive modes of inheritance. The carrier frequency of these two mutations is high in Northern Europe, particularly Scandinavia.3 The clinical features associated with POLG1 mutation include progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO),6 Alpers’ syndrome,7 parkinsonism,8 or a syndrome with sensory ataxia, neuropathy, dysarthria, and ophthalmoplegia (SANDO).9 We present a young woman, homozygous for the W748S mutation and MSCAE that developed palatal tremor and facial dyskinesia and hypertrophic degeneration of the inferior olivary nuclei.",1
"The patient is now 35-years old without family history of epilepsy or movement disorder. She was ﬁrst seen at the age of 19 with focal epileptic seizures. Five years later external ophthalmoplegia and gait unsteadiness were noted and aged 28, during her ﬁrst pregnancy, she was admitted with focal epileptic seizures that were highly resistant to treatment. Two months later her symptoms worsened and included myoclonic jerks in the extremities and facial dyskinesias. Treatment with sodium valproate resulted in acute severe hepatic failure and she underwent a successful liver transplantation. Two years later a cerebral MRI scan showed marked hypertrophic degeneration of the inferior olives (Fig. 1). She denied symptoms of ear clicking.",1
"On examination at age 35, she had a mild cognitive deﬁcit, cerebellar dysarthria, mild external ophthalmoplegia, no nystagmus and no facial nerve dysfunction. She had an asymptomatic palatal tremor, consisting of soundless, bilateral, synchronous and symmetrical 2 Hz contractions of the soft palate plus facial dyskinesias consisting of continuous, rhythmic, undulating wave-like, bilateral periorbital movements.",1
"Intermittent, asymmetric limb myoclonus, cerebellar and sensory ataxia and signs of peripheral neuropathy with loss of reﬂexes and sensory disturbance were also present. Muscle bulk, tone, and power appeared normal. DNA analysis conﬁrmed that she was homozygous for the c. 2243G>C (p. W748S) mutation in POLG1.",1
"Our patient demonstrates the typical features of MSCAE with the combination of focal epilepsy, myoclonus and ataxia as well as sensitivity to sodium valproate.3,10 The interesting features are the rhythmical facial dyskinesia and the asymp-",1

tomatic palatal tremor with its structural correlate of inferior olivary nuclei involvement.,1
"Hypertrophic olivary degeneration (HOD) is clinically associated with palatal tremor and is often caused by pathology in the dentato-rubro-olivary pathways or also called Guillain-Mollaret triangle. Usually the lesion is caused by vascular ischemia, hemorrhage, infection, trauma, neoplasm or demyelination.11 A syndrome called progressive ataxia and palatal tremor (PAPT) has been reported and shows similarities to our case. Even though sporadic PAPT cases had a heterogeneous clinical picture, the cerebellar degeneration was the most symptomatic feature and HOD was common in the presented cases.12 In the familiar forms of PAPT, however, olivary pathology was absent. Palatal tremor with olivary hypertrophy and dentate calciﬁcation has also been described in a form of spinocerebellar ataxia, SCA 20.13",1
In our patient HOD was an incidental MRI ﬁnding without any obvious clinical symptoms. It occurred several years after disease onset. The lack of ear clicks or other symptoms may explain why this clinical picture has not been reported by other authors. Asymptomatic palatal tremor may also be easily overlooked in a routine clinical examination.,1
"Facial dyskinesia appeared as wave-like periorbital involuntary movements on both sides, but not perioral. These asymmetric movements, alternating from one side to the other were most prominent when she was in a resting position. She had never been treated with neuroleptic or antiparkinsonian drugs that might have induced this feature. EEG recorded routinely due to her epilepsy has not shown any correlate with these movements. Orofacial dyskinesia is reported in chorea acanthocytosis together with other symptoms like dysphagia, dysarthria, areﬂexia, seizures, and dementia.14 Facial myorhythmia is also pathognomic for Whipple’s disease mostly localized around the eyes and jaw. Other symptoms as seizures, myoclonus, ophthalmoplegia, and dysarthria are also common. A diagnostic criterion for this entity is small intestine biopsy that excluded the disease.",1
"We present a case with the typical clinical features of POLG1 mutation and additional novel ﬁndings of palatal tremor with HOD on MRI and facial dyskinesia. These ﬁndings expand the clinical spectrum of the syndromes caused by mutation in this gene. Moreover, since palatal tremor is a rare disorder, and often reported as a sporadic entity, we suggest that POLG1 mutation should be considered in patients with this disorder.",1
"Segment 1. The patient shows gait ataxia and mild external ophthalmoplegia. She has bilateral, asymmetrical rhythmical facial dyskinesias, mainly in the periorbital regions. The asymptomatic palatal tremor: soundless, bilateral, synchronous and symmetrical 2Hz contractions of the soft palate.",1

Thalamic Stimulation Does Not Involve a High Rate of Suicide,0
"I read with some concern the paper of Appleby et al. published in the September issue of MDJ.1 The authors write in the abstract, ‘‘Reported rates of depression, cognitive impairment, mania, and behavior change are low, but there is a high rate of suicide in patients treated with DBS, particularly with thalamic and GPi stimulation.’’ In the Results section, the authors provide numbers and percentage of ‘‘those patients that expressed suicidality (deﬁned as suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, or completed suicide).’’ They wrote, ‘‘Most patients underwent DBS for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease (26; 81%); 4 had dystonia (12.5%), 1 had essential tremor (3%), and another had OCD (3%).’’ Then the authors provide details of the brain target for DBS in these patients: ‘‘26 patients (81%) were implanted in the STN, 4 (12.5%) had GPi implants, and 1 (3%) had a VIM implant, and the last patient received an anterior limb of the internal capsule implant.’’ Then, toward the end of the Results section, they wrote, ‘‘The rate of completed suicide was highest in the thalamus group (5.4%).’’",0
"In my reading, these results simply do not add up and the drawn conclusions expressed both in the abstract and in the discussion of that paper do not substantiate, in fact contradict, the ﬁgures and percentage cited. This article is supposed to be a review of the literature and a meta-analysis, but nowhere can one read how the meta-analysis was statistically conducted. To start with, there is no information about the number of patients with the various diagnoses or the number of patients operated on in the various brain targets. There is instead information about number of publications, their geographical origin, gender of patients, etc. There is no mention of any data providing the percentage of patients with suicidality in relation to the number of patients operated on, in any of the brain targets, or for any of the diagnoses.",0
"In the quoted references, I cannot ﬁnd any reference that supports the authors’ claim that thalamic stimulation carries the highest risk for suicidality, and the authors do not give the citation reference numbers to back up their conclusions. To name but one example, the last patient who committed suicide and who ‘‘received an anterior limb of the internal capsule implant’’ is certainly the patient described by Abelson et al. in the (nonquoted) paper on four patients with OCD treated with DBS.2",0
"The authors wrote, ‘‘Since its approval by the FDA in 1997 for use in Parkinson’s disease, DBS has been used to treat essential tremor, dystonia, cluster headaches, and chronic pain1–4’’ and among these 4 quoted references, one (Ref. 4) was actually about DBS for epilepsy. Besides, it is",0
"true that FDA granted approval for thalamic DBS for parkinsonian and essential tremor in 1997, then pallidal DBS and STN DBS for advanced PD in 2001. However, for dystonia, the FDA granted in 2003 a humanitarian device exemption, which is not a full approval.",0
"Instead of providing several tables detailing device-related adverse events (Table 3) and somatic adverse events (table 4), both of which are evidently out of the scope of this paper on psychiatric and neuropsychiatric adverse events, it would have been more helpful to provide tables of the percentage or prevalence of suicides according to target and diagnosis. In my review of the literature, suicidality following DBS is overall rare, and its prevalence is higher in patients with subthalamic DBS compared to thalamic DBS, a ﬁnding contrary to their statement (in the abstract and on page 1726).",0
"The ﬁnal conclusion of this article reads, ‘‘Our ﬁndings are optimistic regarding the use of DBS for psychiatric disorders.’’ Which ﬁndings? I looked repeatedly in the paper for any results, ﬁgures, or tables that would justify such a conclusion but could ﬁnd none. In the context of this study, such a conclusion seems to me in need of reconsideration, and the data need to be clearly provided.",0
"In my view, we are left with a published study that could potentially have been an extremely informative analysis had the authors separated thalamus and subthalamus and had they carefully evaluated the literature that they set themselves to review. The meta-analysis promised in the title of this work was not provided, and the authors fall short of answering the issues at stake.",0

"A 69-year-old woman, 19 years earlier, noticed intermittent turning of her head to the right side which had begun suddenly following a motor vehicle accident. She had sideto-side movement of her head with rotation and tilt to the right side. It was aggravated by stress and suppressed with sensory tricks. There was no family history of dystonia or of prior treatment with neuroleptic medications. She was diagnosed with cervical dystonia with mild head tremor. She tried various oral medications with no improvement. She was never treated with botulinum toxin.",0
"Seven years ago, she developed double vision, drooping of the eyelids, and generalized weakness. She also noted marked reduction of dystonic movements at the same time. Neurological examination revealed bilateral ptosis and diplopia, which worsened on fatigue. She had minimal dystonic head tremor, with torticollis to the right of 208 and right laterocollis of 158. She also had bilateral orbicularis oculi and generalized proximal muscle weakness. The remainder of her neurological examination disclosed no abnormalities. She was diagnosed with generalized seropositive myasthenia gravis and started on pyridostigmine and corticosteroids, which resulted in the improvement of the myasthenic symptoms and signs. On recent follow up, she had minimal head tremor in the side-to-side direction, mild residual weakness of the cervical muscles, and no relapse of cervical dystonia.",0
"A 61-year-old man with cerebral palsy developed blepharospasm several years prior to presentation to our facility. One year earlier, he received botulinum toxin treatment which provided temporary improvement of this disorder. About 6 months before evaluation, he complained of progressive bilateral lower extremity weakness and dysphagia to both solids and liquids. Neurological examination revealed bilateral ptosis, ophthalmoparesis, and mild generalized proximal muscle weakness. His blepharospasm disappeared and none was observed during the examination. Following further investigations including neurophysiological testing (which showed a signiﬁcant decremental response on repetitive nerve stimulation at 3 Hz), he was diagnosed with seropositive generalized myasthenia gravis. He was treated with pyridostigmine, corticosteroids, and azathioprine. A follow-up examination 2 years later showed marked improvement of myasthenic symptoms but with mild residual weakness of the orbicularis oculi. He had no recurrence of blepharospasm.",0
"Approximately 33% of patients diagnosed with focal or segmental dystonia and treated with anticholinergic drugs show a modest improvement in symptoms compared with signiﬁcant improvement in 90% treated with local intramuscular botulinum toxin.1 Botulinum toxin binds at the neuromuscular junction and prevents the release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic terminal. It results in temporary weakness of the skeletal muscles into which it is injected, which can ameliorate the symptoms and signs of dystonia. The median duration of",0
"effect is about 12.5 weeks.2 It is the treatment of choice for cervical dystonia, blepharospasm, spasmodic dysphonia, oromandibular dystonia, and limb dystonia.3",0
"Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder caused by autoantibodies against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor on the postsynaptic membrane at the neuromuscular junction.4 Both our patients had acetylcholine receptor antibody positive generalized myasthenia gravis and both had improvement of their movement disorders. There was marked improvement of torticollis in our ﬁrst patient and resolution of blepharospasm in the second after the development of generalized myasthenia gravis. A review of the literature reveals two reports of patients who had both generalized myasthenia gravis and dystonia. Interestingly, in contrast to our patients, both of them developed only temporary improvement of the dystonia.5,6 Furthermore, in one of these patients, the recurrent dystonia was successfully treated with botulinum toxin.6 It is possible that our patients did not develop a recurrence of dystonia due to mild residual muscle weakness secondary to the myasthenia gravis.",0
Clinical improvement of dystonia after the onset of MG attests to an intriguing relationship between dystonia and MG serving as another example of an experiment of nature. Spontaneous improvement of symptoms in a dystonic patient should direct attention to the possibility of developing a NMJ disorder.,0

"We report a case of an adult-onset, mutation proven Alexander disease characterized by cerebellar and sensory ataxia, the absence of palatal tremor, and very mild white matter changes.1,2 This 61-year-old man presented at the age of 50 years with slowly progressive gait difﬁculties. His past medical history revealed the onset of static but marked forward ﬂexion of the trunk in his ﬁrst decade, but without any motor abnormalities until recently. His sister had been diagnosed with progressive cerebellar ataxia; there were no other affected relatives.",0
"We screened for several of the genetic ataxias, but no mutations were detected in the SCA1/2/3/6/7/14 genes or in the genes responsible for Friedreich’s ataxia and dentatorubro-pallido-luysian atrophy. Electromyography showed no signs of neuropathy or myopathy. SSEP was not performed. MRI demonstrated subtle white matter lesions anteriorly in both temporal lobes, as well as mild atrophy of the cerebellum, brainstem and cervical spinal cord on standard MRI imaging (Fig. 1A–C). Additional Supporting Information may be found in the online version of this article.",0
"As these combined clinical and imaging features were suggestive of Alexander disease, we sequenced the GFAP gene, and found a novel heterozygous c.692T > A missense mutation in exon 4, predicting a p.Leu231His amino acid change; this mutation was not encountered in 210 control chromosomes. Several cases of adult-onset Alexander disease have been reported, mostly with an onset in the third or fourth decade of life. Phenotypic heterogeneity is evident from the variable presence of bulbar symptoms, cerebellar signs, palatal tremor, spastic paresis, and autonomic dysfunction.",0

"Zolpidem is an imidazopyridine agonist with a high afﬁnity for the benzodiazepine a1 subunit site.1 It has been reported that this drug improves motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson’s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and Xlinked dystonia-Parkinsonism syndrome.2–5 Recently, zolpidem has been shown to be effective in the treatment of blepharospasm and the Meige syndrome in combination with botulinum toxin A.6 Here, we report a patient with Meige syndrome, nonresponsive to botulinum toxin A, but successfully treated with oral zolpidem administration.",0

"In conclusion, oral zolpidem may be a useful pharmacologic alternative for patients with Meige syndrome who do not respond to botulinum toxin treatment. However, special precautions are necessary for long-term management with this drug because of the risk of zolpidem abuse, especially in patients with a previous history of substance abuse.15 Movement Disorders, Vol. 23, No. 11, 2008 1620 LETTERS TO THE EDITOR LEGENDS TO THE VIDEO",0

"Chronic bilateral stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is effective in severe Parkinson’s disease (PD).1 However, a few side effects, especially oculomotor manifestations have been reported.2 Understanding their mechanism may help to better deﬁne functional anatomy of this region. A 66-year-old woman was treated by bilateral STN stimulation for PD. A 40% decrease of the Uniﬁed Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor score followed STN stimulation alone with the following parameters: left, contact 2: 3.5 V/60 l second/160 Hz; right, contact 7: 3.5 V/90 l second/160 Hz.",0
"With right stimulation on contact 6 (3.5 V), a counterclockwise TN was found. Except for lower gain of VOR, eye movements were not modiﬁed (Table 2). Vertical saccades could not be correctly recorded. The skew deviation increased. SVV slightly decreased (12.048). With left stimulation on contact 1 (4.5 V), we noticed a clockwise TN. Velocities of downward saccades, downward smooth pursuit gain, and horizontal pendular VOR gain decreased (Table 2). The right sided skew deviation decreased, SVV normalized (10.48).",0
"Previously reported oculomotor side effects of STN stimulation consisted of eyelid apraxia, binocular diplopia, myosis, mydriasis, and contraversive eye deviation.1,2,4–14 TN has been observed during periaqueductal gray matter,15 but not during STN stimulation. STN is involved in saccades and smooth pursuit in primates and humans16–23 and its stimulation could explain some ocular motor side effects such as contraversive eye deviation.10 However, it is unlikely that STN could have induced the TN as it was not observed at low intensity of stimulation",0

"According to the close relationship of iC, riMLF, and stimulation contacts, the contralateral TN reported here could be due to an activation of the iC or an inhibition of the riMLF or both, either due to a direct nucleus or an indirect in/out connecting pathways modulation.
