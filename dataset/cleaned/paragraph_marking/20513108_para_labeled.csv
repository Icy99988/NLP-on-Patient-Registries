"In conclusion, we have demonstrated the absence of LAMP-2 expression in skeletal muscles from a female patient with early-onset overt proximal weakness, many vacuolated ﬁbers, and a de novo novel mutation in the LAMP2 gene. We strongly suggest that the pathogenesis of proximal weakness is more related to autophagic vacuoles than primary LAMP-2 expression. We also believe that there may be other factors that cause cardiomyopathy in Danon disease.",0

"ABSTRACT: Missense mutations in the gene for polymerase c 1 (POLG1) cause a number of phenotypically heterogeneous mitochondrial diseases, most commonly progressive external ophthalmoplegia, and are characterized by the accumulation of multiple, large-scale deletions of mitochondrial DNA. The triad of sensory ataxic neuropathy, dysarthria, and ophthalmoparesis (SANDO) has been demonstrated in a small subset of patients with POLG1 mutations. We report a sporadic case of an 80-year-old compound heterozygote man who presented with SANDO and was found to have three known pathogenic mutations in the POLG1 gene (p.T251I/ p.P587L/p.G848S). To our knowledge, none of these mutations have been demonstrated previously in SANDO. This patient’s late presentation illustrates that a mitochondrial disorder should be considered regardless of age if the clinical symptoms warrant.",1

"Mutations in polymerase c 1 (POLG1) lead to a number of mitochondrial disease phenotypes associated with multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions. Such mutations present clinically in a heterogeneous manner and include both autosomal dominant and recessive forms of progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO); mitochondrial ataxic syndrome without opthalmoplegia (MIRAS); and the clinical triad of sensory ataxic neuropathy, dysarthria, and ophthalmoparesis (SANDO).1,2 There is no speciﬁc treatment for diseases related to POLG1 mutations, although valproic acid is contraindicated, as it may precipate fulminant liver disease. Only a few cases of SANDO associated with POLG1 mutations have been reported.3–8 We report a case of SANDO associated with known pathogenic POLG1 mutations that presented in late life in a compound heterozygote male.",1

"voice, as well as more recent gait instability with near falls and proximal arm weakness. He denied any family history of a similar disorder. A previous workup earlier in the year by another physician had included negative serologic and electrophysiologic testing for myasthenia gravis along with normal, but limited needle electromyography. A biopsy of the left deltoid muscle demonstrated nonspeciﬁc changes, including ﬁber size variability and central nuclei. There were also ragged red and ragged blue (succinate dehydrogenase–positive) ﬁbers in about 3% and 6% of all muscle ﬁbers, respectively, both signifying increased mitochondrial numbers, and cytochrome c oxidase (COX)- negative ﬁbers in about 6% of all ﬁbers. There were also ultrastructural changes of abnormally swollen mitochondria and paracrystalline inclusions (Fig. 1). Respiratory chain complex activity showed an increase in citrate synthase levels, consistent with increased mitochondrial content, but it was otherwise normal.",1
"On neurologic examination at presentation, the patient had moderate to severe bilateral ptosis and lateral rectus palsies with associated horizontal diplopia. His also had a moderately severe nasal, ﬂaccid dysarthria, moderate facial weakness, and mild tongue weakness without any atrophy. His power was reduced in both deltoid muscles 4þ/5 (Medical Research Council scale), but was other-",1

His sensory examination showed mild stocking loss to light touch and pin prick, absent vibratory sensation and impaired joint position sense at the toes, and decreased vibratory sensation at the ankles. He had a positive Romberg sign. His deep tendon reﬂexes were absent at the ankles. His gait was mildly wide-based.",1
"Repeat nerve conduction studies of the right arm and leg demonstrated absent right sural and peroneal sensory nerve action potentials (SNAP) and a moderately reduced superﬁcial radial SNAP amplitude of 7 lV (normal >12 lV) with a normal conduction velocity of 63 m/s, consistent with a sensory axonopathy. Right peroneal motor nerve conduction and minimum F-wave latencies were normal. Needle electromyographic (EMG) study of the right arm and leg demonstrated an excess of low-amplitude, short-duration, occasionally polyphasic motor unit action potentials, without ﬁbrillation potentials or positive sharp waves, and early recruitment in the right iliacus and biceps brachii muscles, consistent with a non-irritative myopathy involving the proximal limbs. Quantitative motor unit analysis was performed on the right orbicularis oris muscle, employing the technique described by Farrugia and Kennett.9 It showed a mean motor unit action potential duration of 3.5 ms (normal range 7.2–11.0 ms), which was indicative of myopathy involving the facial muscles.",1
"SANDO from POLG Mutations MUSCLE & NERVE June 2010 883 FIGURE 2. Location of missense mutations in the polymerase c gene in SANDO. p.T25I1 and p.P587L mutations were identified in cis, in the exonuclease motif and linker regions of the gene, respectively. In addition, the p.G848S mutation was found in the polymerase motif. These mutations have been seen in other mitochondrial phenotypes, such as Alpers syndrome and progressive external ophthalmoplegia, both individually and in combination, but not with SANDO (courtesy of Dr. Robert Naviaux).",1
"The patient had a normal metabolic panel, liver function proﬁle, sedimentation rate, thyroid function, vitamin B12, methylmalonic acid, serum protein and immunoﬁxation electrophoresis, serum amino acid, urine organic proﬁle, lactic acid, ammonia, and creatine phosphokinase, and negative antibodies to extractable nuclear antigen and to Ro and La. He had a mildly elevated glycosylated hemoglobin level of 6.2% and positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA) of 1:160, showing a speckled pattern. His free carnitine level was mildly elevated at 67.2 lmol/L (normal 16–65 lmol/L), short-chain acyl carnitine level moderately increased at 46.1 lmol/L (normal 1–24 lmol/L), and acyl/free ratio modestly increased at 0.73 lmol/L (normal <0.7 lmol/L). Testing of the genes for polyadenylate binding protein nuclear 1 (for oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy), ANT1, and TWINKLE (PEO1) demonstrated normal coding sequences. Direct sequencing of the coding exons of the POLG1 gene showed that the patient had three known deleterious heterozygous missense mutations, c.752C>T (p.T251I), c.1760C>T (p.P587L), and c.2542G>A (p.G848S), located in exons 2, 9, and 15, respectively. All have previously been associated with disease (Fig. 2).",1
