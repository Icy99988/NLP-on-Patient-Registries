"Mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction can cause a variety of diseases known as mitochondrial disorders. Polymerase γ (POLG) is the enzyme responsible for the replication and repair of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Pol γA, the catalytic core of the enzyme, is encoded by the nuclear POLG1 gene. Mutations of this gene are associated with multiple deletions and/or depletion of mtDNA, which may lead to impaired energy production in the mitochondria and the so-called POLG syndromes [1]. Since the discovery of the gene in 1996, more than 100 pathogenic mutations have been linked to a wide range of nonneurological and neurological disorders. Among the neurological manifestations, there is an overlapping phenotypic spectrum that may include myopathy, neuropathy, ptosis, epilepsy, muscle pain, ataxia and progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO). Although rare, cases of parkinsonism have also been described in association with POLG1 mutations. We report on a patient with parkinsonism, PEO, ptosis, and",1

Case report",1
"The patient is an 80-year-old female, and the third of ﬁve siblings. She was born at term after an uneventful pregnancy and labour. Her family history was positive for external ophthalmoplegia with bilateral ptosis and behavioural disturbances in only one of her brothers. Her mother suffered repetitive abortions, but other disorders were not known in either of her parents, who were not consanguineous, as reported by the patient. She ﬁrst presented with progressive bilateral ptosis in her forties and received corrective left eyelid surgery with suboptimal outcome, refusing further interventions. She underwent bilateral cataract extraction at the age of 67. She demonstrated childish behaviour and learning difﬁculties throughout her adult life, as well as compulsive habits such as gathering items over the last twenty years. She also suffered progressive cognitive decline, with difﬁculties in performing her habitual tasks and a degree of social impairment (lack of interaction, indifference, etc.) during the past three years. In the last year, right hand rest tremor and clumsiness were observed. In addition, a loss of facial expression had become evident in the last few years.",1

"and bradykinesia in the upper extremities. No cerebellar or pyramidal signs were found. The patient's Mini Mental State Examination score was 22/30. Neuropsychological tests revealed cognitive impairment with executive dysfunction, language domain impairment and mild apraxia. Serum analyses showed a total CK activity of 92 U/l (normal ≤ 169). Other serum parameters, including the levels of pyruvate, copper, ceruloplasmin, folic acid, vitamin B12 and thyroid hormones, were normal. A brain MRI scan revealed moderate enlargement of the ventricles and diffuse brain atrophy. Bilateral striatal dopamine deﬁciency, which was most marked in the left putamen, was evidenced by N-ﬂuoropropyl-2β-carbomethoxy-3β-4-[123I]iodophenyltropane SPECT. The patient was initiated on levodopa/carbidopa (300/75 mg per day), to which she exhibited a partial response (mild reduction in bradykinesia and rigidity). Electromyography and nerve conduction studies showed no abnormalities, and echocardiography revealed no signiﬁcant disturbances. A mitochondrial disorder was suspected, and a muscle biopsy of the biceps brachii demonstrated ragged red ﬁbres based on Gomori staining (Fig. 1). Southern blot hybridization analysis identiﬁed multiple mtDNA deletions that were conﬁrmed using the long-PCR technique. Given this ﬁnding, the POLG1 gene was sequenced by the standard Sanger method. Total DNA was extracted from blood following written informed consent, and using standard methods. Direct sequencing of PCR amplicons of coding exons of POLG1 was performed as described previously [2]. A novel heterozygous nucleotidic variant, c.2834AN T, was identiﬁed in exon 18 of the POLG1 gene, producing the p.His945Leu amino acid change. In silico analysis using PolyPhen-2 (http://genetics.bwh.hardvard.edu/pph2/) predicted that this change was probably damaging, with a score of 1.000 (sensitivity: 0.00; speciﬁcity: 1.000).

"We report on a case of parkinsonism, PEO, ptosis, and behavioural and cognitive abnormalities associated with a novel mutation in the POLG1 gene. In contrast to other manifestations, parkinsonism is less frequently observed in mutations of this gene. It was ﬁrst described in ﬁve families, with some members presenting levodopa-responsive parkinsonism (n = 15), cataracts, ataxia and hypoacusis in different combinations. Two previously known mutations in the POLG1 gene, as well as one novel mutation, were described in these patients. Two siblings with parkinsonism underwent [18F]β-CFT PET that revealed reduced uptake in the putamen and caudate, in contrast to their healthy siblings who had normal uptake [3]. Since this initial report, 19 more",1
"cases of parkinsonism in POLG1 gene mutation carriers have been reported. Their main clinical features are summarized in Table 1 [1,4–20]. Previous literature shows that all except seven cases presented with PEO and/or ptosis, signs that were also present in our patient. Muscle weakness, neuropathy and ataxia were also common features, not present in the case we report. Similar to our patient, the average age of onset",0
"of the neurological signs was between the 3rd and 4th decades, and parkinsonism usually appeared after several years, tended to improve with dopaminergic treatment, and was associated with a striatal dopaminergic deﬁcit as observed in DaT Scan studies in a few cases. Other features, such as cognitive dysfunction or psychiatric symptoms including depression, anxiety, and obsessive disorders, were much less prevalent. In our patient, behavioural (childish performance) and cognitive abnormalities (learning difﬁculties) were probably the initial manifestations of the disease, emerging in early adulthood, although these symptoms had not previously been investigated. The clinical picture subsequently evolved, with two well recognized phases: an initial stage in which PEO",0

"and ptosis appeared in her 3rd decade, and a second one in which obsessive disorder developed some years later, followed by cognitive decline and parkinsonism, in her 6th decade. It has to be admitted that although all these clinical manifestations can be explained by the genetic variant we report, the lack of genetic study in the sibling with a similar clinical picture or in any other relative (she only has a healthy sister who has declined to be studied) impedes to assess the segregation of this clinical picture. In addition, parkinsonism could be a coexisting condition, particularly if we consider the prevalence of this entity at the age of our patient. Be that as it may, similarly to the patient we describe, it has to be noticed that in contrast to typical PD, parkinsonism associated with POLG1 mutations has additional features, accounting for a more complex clinical phenotype and departing from a diagnosis of PD. On this regard, cognitive impairment is a particularly interesting feature as it is observed in other mitochondrial disorders [21,22], suggesting that the complexity of its pathogenesis extends beyond the dopaminergic system.",0
"Although the exact mechanism by which mitochondrial dysfunction leads to parkinsonism is not clearly understood, accumulating evidence suggests that it plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine and rotenone, inhibitors of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I, have been reported to cause parkinsonism in humans and other primates [23]. Furthermore, several of the genes causative of familial forms of PD are involved in mitochondrial function, including Pink1, parkin and DJ-1 [23]. In addition, mtDNA deletions have been shown in substantia nigra (SN) neurons of PD patients, suggesting that this may be a predisposing factor to the death of these dopaminergic neurons, which are believed to be more vulnerable to mitochondrial dysfunction than other types of neurons [24]. The extent to which POLG1 variants may play a role in the pathogenesis of PD is not well established, but it has been shown that among 441 cases of early onset PD, two cases carried compound heterozygous mutations and the frequency of affected siblings was higher in patients carrying heterozygous POLG1 mutations [19]. In addition, rare variants of the POLG1 CAG-repeat (non-10/11Q variants) in the exon 2 which encodes a polyglutamine tract, are more frequent in PD patients than in controls",0

"Human Pol γ is a heterotrimer comprising a catalytic subunit, Pol γA, and a dimer of an accessory subunit, Pol γB. Pol γA is a 140-kDa polypeptide which has three major domains: a N-terminal Exo domain (which contains the exo active site), a C-terminal Pol domain (which contains the pol active site), and a spacer domain (which separates the Exo and Pol domains in primary sequence). The clinical phenotype of POLG1 mutations depends on the severity of the resultant Pol γ functional defect and the zygosity of the nucleotide variant. A ﬁve-cluster model of Pol γ based on functional aspects has recently been designed, and is capable of predicting the pathogenic potential and biochemical defects of novel mutations [30]. According to this model, the novel mutation reported here (p.His945Leu change) is placed in subcluster 1E",0
"(residues 914–966), which acts to bind the correct deoxynucleotide tri- phosphate substrate (dNTP). Within this region there is a motif known as the Pol B motif (residues 943–958) which establishes speciﬁc contacts with correctly base-paired dNTP in the closed conformation. Mutations at this level disrupt the speciﬁc contacts with the incoming dNTP and reduce the ﬁdelity without affecting DNA binding afﬁnity. Accordingly, mutations at this site are capable of competing for dNTP binding with wild-type Pol γ but are unable to polymerize nucleotides effectively, causing mtDNA damage [30].",0
"Conclusion We report on a novel mutation in the POLG1 gene which leads to an amino acid change, p.His945Leu, associated with parkinsonism accompanied by a nigro-striatal dopaminergic deﬁcit and response to levodopa, cognitive disturbances, obsessive disorder, PEO and ptosis. POLG1 gene mutations should therefore be considered in cases of parkinsonism that display these characteristics. Conﬂict of interest The authors declare that they do not have any conﬂict of interest.
