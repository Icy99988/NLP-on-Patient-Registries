Abstract,0
"Different mutations, or combinations of mutations, in POLG1, the gene encoding pol cA, the catalytic subunit of mitochondrial DNA",0
"polymerase, are associated with a spectrum of clinical presentations including autosomal dominant or recessive progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), juvenile-onset ataxia and epilepsy, and Alpers–Huttenlocher syndrome. Parkinsonian features have been reported",0
"as a late complication of POLG1-associated dominant PEO. Good response to levodopa or dopamine agonists, reduced dopamine",0
uptake in the corpus striatum and neuronal loss of the Substantia Nigra pars compacta have been documented in a few cases. Here,0
"we report two novel mutations in POLG1 in a compound heterozygous patient with autosomal recessive PEO, followed by pseudo-",1
orthostatic tremor evolving into levodopa-responsive parkinsonism. These observations support the hypothesis that mtDNA dysfunction,1
is engaged in the pathogenesis of idiopathic Parkinson’s disease.,0

1. Introduction,0
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is faithfully replicated,0
"by DNA polymerase V (pol V), an enzyme composed of",0
"a single, 145 kDa catalytic subunit (pol cA) bound to",0
"two, 55 kDa accessory subunits (pol cB). Pol cA is encoded",0
"by POLG1, a 23-exon gene located on human chromosome",0
15. Functional genetic variants of POLG1 are present in,0
approximately 0.5% of the general population. Numerous,0
POLG1 mutations have been associated with a spectrum,0
of clinical presentations including autosomal dominant or,0
"recessive progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO),",0
"juvenile-onset ataxia and epilepsy, and Alpers–Huttenl-",0
"ocher syndrome. At the molecular level, PEO patients are",0
characterized by the accumulation of a collection of deleted,0
"mtDNA species in affected tissues, notably skeletal muscle",0
"and brain. Additional symptoms, including migraine, epi-",0
"lepsy, peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, premature ovarian",0
"failure, hypogonadism and male hypofertility, may occur",0
in different PEO families and with different POLG1 muta-,0
tions [1–4]. Parkinsonism is a rare and late-onset complica-,0
tion of POLG1-associated PEO [3–5]. We report here on a,0
patient presenting progressive external ophthalmoplegia,1
followed by pseudo-orthostatic tremor and parkinsonism.,1
Molecular analysis showed that this patient is a compound,1
heterozygous for two novel mutations of the POLG1 gene.,1

2. Case description,0
The patient is a 54 year-old (yo) man from Central Italy.,1
"His father died at 71 years of lung cancer, had non-insulin",0
dependent diabetes mellitus but was free from any neuro-,0
"logical symptom. The 82 yo mother, a 47 yo brother and",0
two 29 and 24 yo daughters are all alive and well. The pro-,0
positus was born at term after an uneventful pregnancy. In,0
"contrast to what was reported previously [6], this patient",0
"developed PEO with bilateral ptosis at 30 years of age, fol-",1
"lowed by progressive dysphonia with rhinolalia, dysphagia,",1
"proximal muscle weakness and wasting, and tendon are-",1
"flexia. Reduction of caloric intake, caused by severe dys-",1
"phagia and the onset of chronic diarrhoea, resulted in",1
severe body weight loss. At 50 years of age the patient,1
developed tremor in the standing position (dominant fre-,1
"quency at 6.2 Hz) initially affecting the left lower limb, then",0
"both lower limbs, with occasional mild resting tremor of",1
the hands. This patient was included in a recent report,0
on 4 cases affected by levodopa-responsive pseudo-ortho-,0
static tremor in parkinsonism (case 3 in [6]). In the follow-,0
ing 2 years he developed extra-pyramidal rigidity with a,1
"cogwheel sign, reduced tapping (left > right) and postural",1
instability (Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale-,0
UPDRS motor score 21 points). Physical examination,0
"showed a hypomimic face, hypophonia, bilateral ptosis,",1
"ophthalmoplegia, mild symmetrical proximal muscle weak-",1
ness (Medical Research Council grade 4+) and absence of,0
lower limb tendon reflexes. An ECG and structural brain,1
MRI were both normal. A Single-Photon Emission Com-,0
puted Tomography (SPECT) using ([(123)I]-2b-carbome-,0
thoxy-3b-(-4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl)-nortropane,0
(I-FP-CIT SPECT) revealed a bilaterally reduced dopa-,0
mine uptake in the corpus striatum (right > left). Serum,0
creatine kinase (CK) level was 2156 U/L (normal < 140,1
U/L). An EMG was compatible with axonal sensory neu-,1
ropathy associated with myopathic features. The patient,1
was initially treated with low doses of dopamine agonists,0
(pramipexole 2.1 mg/day) associated with levodopa up to,0
400 mg/day with disappearance of standing legs tremor,0
and reduction in UPDRS motor score.,0
Two years later he complained of end-of-dose deteriora-,0
"tion, with re-occurrence of the disabling standing tremor,",1
which appeared 1.5–2.5 h after each single levodopa,0
(UPDRS motor score was 27 in ‘‘on” state and 42 in ‘‘off”,0
state) and was associated with severe anxiety and panic,1
attacks during the ‘‘off” states. Levodopa was increased,0
to 600 mg/day and entacapone was added (1200 mg/day).,0
The patient did not report further fluctuations for the next,0
"6 months, when he developed peak-dose dyskinesias, re-",0
occurrence of end-of-dose deterioration and severe stand-,0
ing tremor. Entacapone was substituted with tolcapone,0
100 mg t.i.d. with reduction of dyskinesias and ‘‘off” state.,0
"Since then, dysphagia has progressively worsened, with fur-",1
"ther loss of weight because of malnutrition, requiring the",1
positioning of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy for,0
enteral nutrition. Onset of ventilatory failure has required,1
mechanical ventilation. The serum CK level remains high,1
"(6143 U/L), with worsening and spreading of the muscle",0
"weakness. High serum CK is an unusual, but occasionally",1
"reported, finding in POLG1-associated PEO with multiple",1
"mtDNA deletions: for instance, Hudson et al. [5] report a",0
patient (individual II:8) with serum CK levels > 2500 U/l.,0
The tremor and the ‘‘off” state now occur 1.5–2 h after,0
"levodopa administration, which must be repeated 7–8 times",0
per day. In the last months the patient has also developed,0
progressive cognitive dysfunction associated with psychotic,1
features.,0
3. Methods,0
Southern blot analysis of mtDNA was carried out on,0
DNA extracted from skeletal muscle following standard,0
procedures [7] and using the ECL chemiluminescence as,0
the detection method. DNA from peripheral blood lym-,0
phocytes was used as a template to amplify the 22 coding,0
exons of the POLG1 gene (exons 223). Polymerase chain,1
"reaction (PCR) conditions were 96 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for",0
"20 s and 72 °C for 60 s, for 30 cycles plus as initial denatur-",0
ation step at 96 °C for 2 min. PCR fragments were ana-,0
lyzed by automated nucleotide sequencing using the Big-,0
Dye terminator Ready Reaction Kit version 2 on a 3100,0
Genetic Analyzer Automated Sequencer (Applied Biosys-,0
tems). The sequence variants found in the patient were,0
searched for in available relatives as well as in 100 consec-,0
utive control subjects (200 alleles).,0
4. Results,0
A skeletal muscle biopsy taken when the patient was 32,0
years old showed the presence of several ragged-red fibers,1
"with variation of fiber caliber and nuclear centralization,",1
and reduced or absent reactivity to cytochrome c oxidase,1
(Fig. 1A). Sequence analysis of mtDNA excluded the pres-,0
ence of point mutations commonly associated with,0
"MERRF and MELAS. However, Southern blot analysis",0
revealed the presence of a collection of deleted mtDNA,0
species in addition to wild-type mtDNA (Fig. 1B) [6].,0
These results prompted us to consider the possibility,0
of mutation(s) in one of the nucleus-encoded genes com-,0
"monly associated with mtDNA instability and PEO,",1
"namely Twinkle, ANT1 and POLG1. Sequence analysis",0
of the first two genes ruled out the presence of patho-,0
"genic mutations. However, sequence analysis of the entire",0
coding region of the POLG1 gene led us to the identifi-,1
cation of two novel heterozygous mutations. One is a,0
"c.1288A > T transversion, predicting a p.M430L amino-",1
"acid substitution. The second is a c.2752T > C transition,",1
determining the aminoacid substitution p.W918R,1
"(Fig. 2A). Segregation analysis, carried out in available",0
"members of the family (Fig. 2B), revealed the presence",0
of the 2752T > C heterozygous mutation in the mother,1
"of the patient and in the two healthy daughters, while",0
no mutation was detected in his brother.,0

5. Discussion,0
We found two novel heterozygous POLG1 mutations in,0
"a compound heterozygous patient characterized by PEO,",1
muscle weakness and later onset levodopa-responsive,1
pseudo-orthostatic tremor and parkinsonism [6].,1
The maternal allele predicts a p.W918R aminoacid sub-,1
stitution in a highly conserved position in the pol cA poly-,0
merase domain (http://dir-apps.niehs.nih.gov/polg/) [8].,0
The paternal allele harbors a c.1288A > T transversion pre-,1
dicting the replacement of the p.M430 residue into an L,1
residue. M430 is contained within the so-called spacer,0
"Fig. 1. Morphological and molecular findings in skeletal muscle. (A) Top panel, NADH dehydrogenase staining shows RRF (asterisks); bottom panel,",0
"cytochrome c oxidase staining of a serial muscle section shows several fibers with reduced or absent reactivity, including the same two RRF shown in the",1
top panel (asterisks). (B) Southern blot analysis on PvuII-linearized mtDNA performed on the muscle biopsy of the patient (P) and a control (C). Both P,0
"and C samples show a 16.6 kb band corresponding to wild-type mtDNA (arrow). In addition, the P sample shows a collection of smaller bands",0
corresponding to deletion-containing mtDNA species.,0
"Fig. 2. (A) Identification of POLG1 mutations by sequence analysis. The electropherograms show the c.1288A > T transversion, predicting a p.M430L",1
"aminoacid substitution and the c.2752T > C transition, predicting a p.W918R aminoacid substitution. (B) Family pedigree. The solid black square symbol",1

"domain, a region encompassing the midportion of pol cA,",0
which in multicellular eukaryotes interacts with two pol cB,0
accessory subunits to form a functionally active trimeric,0
"holoenzyme. Pol cB orthologs are absent in fungi, which",0
can explain why M430 is conserved in metazoan pol cA,0
"sequences but not in fungal orthologs (for instance,",0
MIP1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (Fig. 2C). Segregation,0
analysis in the family and absence of either mutation in,0
200 control alleles further support the pathogenic role of,0
the mutations.,0
The role of POLG1 genetic variants in the pathogenesis,0
of parkinsonism is suggested by several reports. Parkinson-,0
ism was documented in 13 affected members of five out of,0
seven POLG1 mutant PEO families reported by Luoma,0
et al. [3]. Three of these families displayed dominant trans-,0
mission of the trait and were found to carry a heterozygous,0
"c.2864A > G (p.Y955C) mutation, one of the most com-",0
mon pathogenic variants of POLG1 [9]. In two additional,0
families both parkinsonism and PEO were transmitted as,0
"an allegedly recessive trait. However, while the three",0
affected members of the first of these families carried two,0
"allelic POLG1 mutations, namely c.1402A > G",0
"(p.N468D) and c.3313G > A (p.A1105T), only the latter",0
was found in heterozygosity in the single patient of the sec-,0
ond family. Good response to levodopa was documented in,0
all patients to whom this treatment had been given.,0
Five additional POLG1 mutant patients belonging to,0
three families were described with a combination of PEO,0
"and parkinsonism, but in some of these cases the patho-",0
genic role of the mutations remains controversial. This is,0
the case for a family including a 49 yo woman with autoso-,0
"mal dominant PEO, neuropathy, hypogonadism and par-",0
kinsonism and her 59 yo brother with overt parkinsonian,0
features [4]. Multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions in,0
muscle and a heterozygous POLG1 missense mutation,0
"c.2492A > G, leading to p.Y831C aminoacid replacement,",0
were found in the proband and her affected brother. The,0
"patient was successfully treated with levodopa. However,",0
the c.2492A > G transition has been reported in about,0
2% of control subjects in Poland and in normal controls,0
"in Finns [10,11] and Italians (MZ and FI, personal obser-",0
vation). These observations suggest that the p.Y831C ami-,0
noacid substitution is a non-pathogenic variant in different,0
European populations.,0
"A second family included several PEO patients, one also",0
being affected by parkinsonism. In this family autosomal,0
dominant PEO segregated with a c.1532G > A heterozy-,0
"gous missense mutation (p.S511N) in exon 8, in combina-",0
tion with an intronic variant c.2070 + c.158G > A in cis,0
[5]. The subject also affected by parkinsonism was found,0
to carry an allelic in-trans change c.1389G > T (p.L463F),0
"the pathogenic role of which is as yet not determined,",0
although the latter was the only change detected in an,0
unaffected sibling.,0
A third family was composed of two sisters with early-,0
onset parkinsonism and signs of sensorimotor axonal,0
"peripheral neuropathy, without PEO; both were compound",0
"heterozygous, carrying the already reported c.2557C > T",0
"(p.R853W) in exon 16 [12] of one allele, while the other",0
"allele carried a second, novel mutation c.2209C > A",0
(p.G737R) in exon 13. One sister was treated with levodopa,0
at low dosage but she developed early oromandibular,0
"dyskinesias, the other was treated with dopamine agonists.",0
"Besides the POLG1 mutant patients mentioned above, a",0
heterozygous mutation c.1121G > A (p.R374Q) was,0
reported in exon 1 of the Twinkle in a single family com-,0
"posed of 10 PEO patients, three of whom had also parkin-",0
"sonism [13]. Finally, a PEO patient with a levodopa-",0
"responsive parkinsonism, dyskinesias and motor fluctua-",0
tions [14] was shown to harbor mtDNA deletions in muscle,0
but no mutation was found in either of the known PEO-,0
associated genes.,0
A comparative study of 420 Parkinson’s disease patients,0
and controls did not support the role for common POLG1,0
"genetic variants in parkinsonism, concluding that domi-",0
nant POLG1 mutations are a rare cause of parkinsonism,0
[15]. The hypothesis that length variants of the pol cA,0
polyglutamine tract may predispose to idiopathic sporadic,0
Parkinson’s disease was suggested by studies on Finns,0
"[3,11], but has not as yet been confirmed in other popula-",0
"tions. On the other hand, POLG1 mutations are not the",0
only cause of mtDNA defects associated with parkinson-,0
ism [16].,0
"Interestingly, high levels of deleted mtDNAs were",0
recently reported in neurons of the Substantia Nigra pars,0
compacta in aged individuals. Patients with Parkinson’s,0
disease showed levels of deleted mtDNA that were signifi-,0
cantly higher than in age-matched control brains [17].,0
These recent results support the long-lasting hypothesis,0
that mitochondrial dysfunctions play a role in the patho-,0
"genesis of Parkinson’s disease, as well as other adult-onset",0
"neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease,",0
Huntington’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,0
"[18]. Interestingly, in two patients [12], including ours,",0
dyskinesias heralded the parkinsonism associated with,0
POLG1 mutations. The latter can be concealed by the pres-,0
ence of peripheral neuropathy and muscle weakness.,0
The identification of two novel POLG1 mutations,0
expressing a phenotype characterized by PEO and parkin-,0
sonism supports the hypothesis that loss of mtDNA integ-,0
rity is implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s,0
disease. Combination of myopathic and neuromuscular,0
symptoms with parkinsonism should prompt to include,0
the screening of the POLG1 gene in the diagnostic work-,0
"out, especially, but not exclusively, when the syndrome is",0
inherited.,0
