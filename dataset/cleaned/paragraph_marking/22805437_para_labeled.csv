"Received in revised form 15 June 2012 Accepted 17 June 2012 Keywords: Polymerase gamma Mitochondrial DNA Polyneuropathy Gastroparesis a b s t r a c t Clinical expression of POLG mutations is largely variable. We present a patient with a new mutation in spacer region of mitochondrial polymerase gamma protein (P765T). The clinical picture is characterized by the presence of sensory–ataxic neuropathy, ophthalmoplegia, dysarthria and gastroparesis, which had not been previously observed in ataxia neuropathy spectrum. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

"DNA polymerase gamma (POLG), the only DNA polymerase found in mitochondria, is entirely responsible for all DNA synthetic reactions including mtDNA replication and repair (Hance et al., 2005). POLG is a heterodimeric enzyme containing a Pol I-like catalytic core (PolgA) and an accessory subunit (PolgB), encoded by POLG at locus 15q25 and POLG2 at locus 17q24.1, respectively (Chan and Copeland, 2009). PolgA possesses both polymerase and proofreading exonuclease activities; PolgB increases enzyme's processivity (Lee et al., 2009). Mutations in the catalytic subunit of POLG can cause mtDNA instability, inducing its deletion and/or depletion. Mutation database (http://tools.niehs.nih.gov/ polg/) currently lists more than 150 POLG mutations, which are evenly distributed over the protein sequence. In addition to the clinical heterogeneity, POLG mutations can be either dominant or recessive, posing a great diagnostic challenge for the clinician.",0
"The phenotypic spectrum is wide, including encephalopathy, epilepsy, ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, neuropathy, myopathy and hepatopathy. Among neurological features of POLG related disorders, the ataxia neuropathy spectrum (ANS) has been deﬁned, comprising mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndrome (MIRAS) and sensory ataxia neuropathy dysarthria and ophthalmoplegia (SANDO). We report a P765T POLG missense mutation in a patient with sensory–",0

To our knowledge, this mutation of POLG coding region has not been reported previously (Cohen and Naviaux, 2010). ⁎ Corresponding author at: Neurology Department, CHU Brugmann, Université Libre de Bruxelles, Place A.

"A 52 year-old Moroccan woman, presented with a 10-year history of drooping eyelids (without daytime ﬂuctuation) and slurred speech, she developed over the past six months progressive gait instability, leg numbness and inability to feel the ground under her feet. Several weeks prior to admission, she suffered from anorexia and had a dramatic weight loss; she lost 15 kg over past two months. She was complaining of early satiety, bloating, upper-abdominal discomfort and tendency to constipation. The patient's deceased mother had a similar bilateral ptosis, without any other ocular signs, her parents were not consanguineous. The patient has one healthy daughter.",1
"On neurological examination, she had unaltered mental status, bilateral ptosis, complete ophthalmoplegia, optic discs atrophy. Pupils were equally reactive. A ﬂaccid type dysarthria was noted. She had mild upper and lower limb muscle weakness with distal predominance. Deep tendon jerks were absent, plantar responses were ﬂexor. Muscular tone was normal, no dysmetria was observed. Sensation to touch and pin prick was normal. She had impaired vibratory and position sensation in both feet. Gait was staggering and wide-based, which made the Romberg test impracticable. General examination was otherwise unremarkable.",1
"The patient had normal liver, renal and thyroid functions, normal electrolytes, sedimentation rate, creatine kinase, serum protein electrophoresis, serum lactate and urine organic acid proﬁle. A 1.5 Tesla brain MRI showed mild cortical–subcortical atrophy without any other parenchymal abnormalities. Sensory nerve conduction studies showed low amplitude radial sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) (4.8 μV; normal >20 μV) and absent sural SNAP. Motor conduction velocities were decreased in the median nerve",1

"(44 m/s; normal>48 m/s) and the tibial nerve (35 m/s; normal> 40 m/s). F-wave latencies were mildly prolonged in the tibial nerve (minimal latency 58.8 ms; normalb58 ms). This is suggestive of an axonal sensori-motor neuropathy with sensory predominance. Needle electromyographic studies (EMG) showed some polyphasic motor unit action potentials in upper and lower extremities. These were also found in the orbicularis oris, orbicularis oculi and sternocleidomastoid muscles, which also showed a myogenic EMG pattern with short, low-amplitude motor unit action potentials. Brainstem auditory evoked potentials and blink reﬂex were normal. Neuro-ophthalmologic examination (including electro-retinography) suggested chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia without retinopathy. X-ray studies demonstrated gastric and bowel distention. Isotope gastric emptying showed markedly delayed emptying, consistent with gastroparesis (Fig. 1).",1
"Deltoid muscle immunohistochemistry showed changes characteristic of a muscular dystrophy with COX-negative ﬁbers, suggesting mitochondrial disorder. Electron microscopy showed paracrystalline mitochondrial inclusions (Fig. 2). All oxidative phosphorylation enzyme complexes were diminished on mitochondrial enzymatic activity assays. Analysis of TYMP gene demonstrated normal coding sequences. Direct sequencing of POLG gene exons showed a homoor hemizygous",1
"point mutation in 765 codon (P765T) located in exon 14, which is an evolutionary conserved amino acid. The MLPA analysis performed indicates the mutation at homozygous state in our patient. The patient's daughter carries the same mutation at heterozygous state. Discussion",1
"We report a patient with dramatic weight loss, gastroparesis, ptosis, ophthalmoplegia and peripheral neuropathy. The latter caused signiﬁcant sensory ataxia. The absence of dysmetria and the ﬂaccid character of the dysarthria were inconsistent with additional cerebellar involvement. Muscular involvement was proven by the biopsy suggestive of mitochondrial disorder. Most of our patient's features, and particularly sensory–ataxic neuropathy, dysarthria and ophthalmoplegia, ﬁt best",1
"with SANDO of the ANS, typically associated with POLG mutations (Van Goethem et al., 2001; Santoro et al., 2006). Our patient's clinical picture may be also evocative of ‘mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy’ (MNGIE) (Nishino et al., 2000) but was excluded by the absence of white matter abnormalities on MRI and normal TYMP sequencing. The POLG protein maintains mitochondrial DNA integrity and replication (Kasiviswanathan et al., 2010). Its catalytic subunit contains exonuclease and",0

"polymerase domains separated by spacer (Lee et al., 2009). This has two subdomains involved in intrinsic processivity and DNA–protein interaction, respectively (Lee et al., 2009). Our patient's P765T mutation is situated in the intrinsic processivity subdomain, thought to impart additional enzyme processivity through additional primer-template interactions. Mutations in the spacer region induce varied biochemical",0
"abnormalities and associated clinical manifestations (Wong et al., 2008). Our patient shows features described in other mutations in POLG spacer unit. G763R POLG mutation was associated with progressive external ophthalmoplegia and sensorimotor neuropathy (Santoro et al., 2006), and A767D mutation with epilepsy without any peripheral nervous system involvement (Horvath et al., 2006). In our patient, a novel POLG mutation is associated with ANS plus gastroparesis, which has not been observed previously. The digestive dysregulation could be the result of energy deprivation following mitochondrial loss of function due to accumulation of mtDNA mutations/deletions and decline of respiratory chain function with severe consequences for all energy-dependent cellular functions, including gastric nerve cells. Our report illustrates clinical variability of POLG mutations and underlines the importance of further biochemical and translational research to better address the pathogenicity of POLG dysfunction. In addition, gastric dysmotility should be more readily searched for in this clinical conjuncture.",0
