"Compound Heterozygous Polymerase Gamma Gene Mutation in a Patient With Alpers Disease Javier F. Cardenas, MD, and R. Stephen Amato, MD",1
"Alpers disease is a mitochondrial depletion syndrome characterized by psychomotor retardation, intractable epilepsy, and liver failure. Polymerase gamma (POLG) gene mutations are a known cause of the disease. We describe a case in which a 14-month-old female presented with epilepsia partialis continua evolving into generalized status epilepticus. Treatment with multiple antiepileptic medications and the ketogenic diet eliminated her seizures, but she remained severely encephalopathic. Magnetic resonance imaging showed diffuse atrophy of gray-matter structures. She ultimately developed liver failure and died. Mitochondrial analysis revealed compound heterozygosity for 3 POLG gene mutations, 2 of which were previously unreported.",1

"14-month-old female with a history of poor weight gain and persistently loose stools presented with new-onset epilepsia partialis continua. Her parents reported irritability several days before admission but denied symptoms of illness. She was initially noted to have intermittent, rhythmic jerking of her left arm with a clenched left hand. She was alert and afebrile but was taken to an urgent care center where she was described as having myoclonic jerking of her bilateral upper extremities. Upon arrival to the intensive care unit, she had generalized, tonic-clonic jerking; she was treated with antiepileptic drugs and intubated. The initial evaluation revealed a weight greater than 2 standard deviations below the mean, with height and head circumference measurements in the 40th and 25th percentiles, respectively. The initial laboratory and neuroimaging studies were unrevealing for infectious, inflammatory, or metabolic causes. Cerebrospinal fluid",1
revealed an elevated lactate of 4.0 mEq/L.,1
"A trend electroencephalogram showed persistent generalized epileptiform discharges, and antiepileptic therapy was escalated to the point of pentobarbital suppression. Valproate was deliberately avoided because of a concern for a possible mitochondrial etiology of disease. The patient ultimately responded to multidrug therapy that included the ketogenic diet. After extubation, the patient was severely encephalopathic and unable to communicate, feed, or dress herself. She had persistent episodes of asymmetric myoclonic activity of the upper extremities that did not correspond with an elec-",1

Repeated neuroimaging revealed global cerebral atrophy involving both the cortex and basal ganglia (Fig 1).",1
The diagnosis of Alpers disease was finalized based on muscle biopsy and genetic testing. Electron microscopy showed reduced mitochondria with abnormal cristae and vacuolization (Fig 2). Mitochondrial analysis revealed a DNA polymerase gamma1 (POLG) heterozygous mutation. A previously reported c911T > G (p. L30 4R) mutation was accompanied by an unknown mutation c.1174C > G (PL39 2V) and a 3240-3242 duplication (pR1081dup). Parental testing revealed paternal presence of the known mutation and the existence of both unknown POLG mutations in the mother.,1
"The patient was discharged after prolonged hospitalization. She remained at home for several weeks with continuous care but was readmitted with coagulopathy and elevated liver enzymes. Her seizures returned, and she was found to be unable to make ketones in her urine. She died approximately 5 months after her initial presentation. Alpers Disease",1
"Alpers’ disease, also known as Alpers Huttenlocher syndrome and progressive neuronal degeneration of childhood with liver disease, was initially described by Bernard Alpers in 1931.1-3 He detailed the neuropathological degeneration of cerebral gray matter in a 4-month-old female with intractable epilepsy.1 Huttenlocher et al3 reported similar pathologic findings in 2 children who also developed liver failure and death by 3 years of age in 1976.3 Harding2 detailed the cere- 62 1071-9091/10/$-see front matter © 2010 Elsevier Inc.
