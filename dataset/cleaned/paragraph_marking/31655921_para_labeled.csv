"A 3-year-old girl presented with severe epilepsy in the context of Borrelia infection. After ceftriaxone/lidocaine administration, she showed secondarily generalized focal crises that led to neurological and motor sequelae. Genetic studies identified in the patient two heterozygous POLG mutations (c.2591A>G; p.Asn864Ser and c.3649G>C; p.Ala1217Pro). Through analysis of POLG activity in cultured fibroblasts, we confirmed that the mutations altered the mtDNA turnover. Moreover, patient fibroblasts were more sensitive than controls in the presence of a mitochondrial replication-affecting drug, the antiretroviral azidothymidine. To test if ceftriaxone treatment could worsen the deleterious effect of the patient mutations, toxicity assays were performed. Cell toxicity, without direct effect on mitochondrial respiratory function, was detected at different antibiotic concentrations. The clinical outcome, together with the different in vitro sensitivity to ceftriaxone among patient and control cells, suggested that the mitochondrial disease symptoms were hastened by the infection and were possibly worsened by the pharmacological treatment. This study underscores the benefit of early genetic diagnosis of the patients with mitochondrial diseases, since they may be a target group of patients especially vulnerable to environmental factors.",1
"Keywords Mitochondrial disease . Mitochondrial DNA . Mitochondrial DNA polymerase . Azidothymidine . Ceftriaxone Introduction Human mitochondria contain their own genome, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), encoding for two ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), 22 transfer RNAs (tRNAs), and a subset of proteins required for the oxidative phosphorylation [1]. The replicase DNA polymerase γ (pol γ) is the responsible for mtDNA replication and repair in mitochondria. Accordingly, pol γ is important for mtDNA maintenance and cellular energy supply, and reduced pol γ activities lead to mtDNA",0

"depletion and impairment of cellular metabolism. The pol γ holoenzyme consists of a catalytic subunit (encoded by POLG), which possesses both polymerase and proofreading exonuclease activities in separate domains, and a dimeric form of its accessory subunit (encoded by POLG2), which increases enzyme processivity [2].",0
"In 2001, the first disease mutations were identified in POLG [3]. Since then, over 200 mutations in POLG have been associated with mitochondrial diseases (http://tools.niehs. nih. gov/polg/) [4–6]. The identification of disease-causing POLG mutations is challenging because POLG gene locus is highly polymorphic and the appearance of disease symptoms can be dependent on epigenetic and environmental factors [5, 7]. Pathogenic mutations have been found to affect the activity of the polymerase, the fidelity of replication, and the formation of the holoenzyme [2]. The clinical identification of POLG-related diseases is difficult because patients present an overlapping range of symptoms and signs with multiple organ system involvement and with variable severity [6]. Clinical phenotype expresses habitually in the central and peripheral nervous, musculoskeletal, and gastrointestinal systems [5, 6, 8]. The disease onset is very variable, ranging from infancy to late adulthood, being the most frequent age of onset during childhood and adolescence. Both autosomal dominant",0
and recessive transmission have been documented for POLG deficient patients [4].,0
"Environmental factors, like infection or pharmacological treatment, can precipitate the onset of POLG disease. For example, infection with human herpesvirus 6 unmasked the POLG mutation phenotypes in two young children, contributing to a more rapid clinical deterioration [9]. The use of antiviral therapies based on nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) provides an example of pharmacological induction of a POLG disease phenotype, since inhibition of mitochondrial pol γ is a common side effect of NRTIs, leading to azidothymidine (AZT)-induced mtDNA depletion [10–12]. Thus, certain POLG mutations facilitate the NRTI-induced toxicity [13, 14].",0
Here we report the identification of two POLG mutations in a 3-year-old girl that presented with severe epilepsy in the context of an infectious process and developed sudden neurological signs during the treatment of the infection. We analyze the pathogenicity of the POLG mutations encountered in the patient and analyze the possible contribution of the pharmacological treatment to the disease progression. Materials and methods Cell culture and cell growth assays,0
"Control (C and C3) and patient (P) primary skin-derived fibroblasts were obtained from a 1-month-old child, a 3-yearold child, and the patient, respectively.

"the first epileptic event appeared. At 3 years of age, the patient presented severe epilepsy (more than 10 episodes per day) in the context of an infectious process. At this time, she started treatment with valproate with good seizure control. IgM antiBorrellia titers were high, and in the physical examination, insect bite was observed. Intramuscular treatment with ceftriaxone/lidocaine was indicated, and after that, she presented an episode of secondarily generalized focal crisis, hypertonia, and myoclonus of the 4 limbs. After 4 days, she was discharged from the hospital maintaining an adequate level of consciousness and motor skills. After the second ceftriaxone/ lidocaine injection, she presented again a new secondarily generalized focal crisis refractory to treatment associating consciousness level and motor deterioration. A single high blood lactate value was reported (4.9 mmol/l: reference values (RV), < 2.0 mmol/l). Neuroimaging studies disclosed an increase of the subarachnoid space at the frontoparietal level and an atrophy of the left hemisphere. Pale eye fundus was also observed. Treatment with phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and leviracetam led to seizure control. She occasionally presented motor focal seizures and upper extremity myoclonus. At 4 years of age, she was admitted to the neuropediatric department of our hospital and she presented with encephalopathy and motor disturbances including inexpressive facies, facial hypomimia, axial hypotonia, hypo/areflexia, distal limb increased tone, and right tetraparesis. She had lost deambulation and disclosed difficulties in handling objects. Drooling was also observed. Electroencephalogram disclosed spontaneously slow and poorly organized trace when compared with agematched controls. Frequent paroxysmal outbreaks of highvoltage delta waves in bioccipital regions with maximums and right predominance activated during sleep were observed. Mitochondrial biomarkers such as serum/plasma FGF21, amino acids, and lactate disclosed normal results. In cerebrospinal fluid, lactate was normal, but high total protein values (190 mg/dl: RV, 15–50) and deep cerebral folate deficiency 3 nmol/ l (RV, 35–124) was observed, supporting the diagnosis of a mitochondrial disorder [25].",1
Genetic analysis,0
"The presence of mtDNA pathogenic point mutations and deletions were excluded. Next-generation sequencing analysis identified in the patient two missense changes in POLG gene (NM_002693.2) involving evolutionarily conserved amino acid residues of the polymerase domain (Fig. 1a).

"2.165e−5 in the general population in gnomAD (Genome Aggregation Database). The familiar study confirmed that both mutations were present in different alleles in the patient. Suitable prediction software packages (Polyphen 2, Pmut, Mutation Taster) assigned high scores for pathogenicity to both mutations. We aligned 210 POLG sequences from different animals and observed that the asparagine at amino acid position 864 was conserved in 100% of the sequences and the alanine at position 1217 in 98.6%.

"To analyze the effect of the POLG mutations on mtDNA levels in patient tissues, mtDNA related to nDNA was quantitated in a muscle biopsy of the patient and compared with 4 controls. The amount of mtDNA detected in the patient was close to that in the controls. In patient-derived fibroblasts, a mild reduction in mtDNA content (18%) compared with control fibroblasts was detected. When cells were grown in mitochondrial biogenesis–inducing conditions (galactose-containing medium [28]), the reduction became more apparent (26%) (Fig. 1b).",0
"To analyze genetic complementation of the POLG mutations, we generated patient (P) and control (C) fibroblast cell lines expressing the canonical version of POLG (PPOLG-WT and CPOLG-WT respectively). A control cell line overexpressing POLG with the dominant mutation c.2864A>G, p.Y955C in the polymerase domain was also generated (CPOLG-Y955C). This dominant mutation has been described to induce severe mtDNA depletion [29]. Overexpression was confirmed by SDS-PAGE separation and immunodetection of total protein lysates. A band of approximately 140 kDa corresponding to POLG protein was observed in all overexpressing cell lines (Fig. 1c).",0
"mtDNA related to nDNA was next examined in these cell lines. The overexpression of the POLG p.Y955C variant in control fibroblasts induced severe mtDNA depletion (54%), as expected, leading to a strong reduction in the mitochondrial encoded CIV subunit I (p.MT-CO1) (Fig. 1c) and to a significant decrease of CIV activity (Fig. 1d). On the other side, mtDNA content was not different in CPOLG-WT fibroblasts compared with C fibroblasts, whereas a significant increase in mtDNA copy number was observed in patient overexpresing cell line, PPOLG-WT, related to P fibroblasts both in glucose medium and in galactose-containing medium (Fig. 1e), suggesting that the mtDNA reduction in the patient is complemented by overexpression of the canonical version of POLG. p.MT-CO1 subunit amount as well as CIVactivity was not altered in patient fibroblasts compared with control (Fig",0
"c, d), indicating that the combination of the two recessive variations present in the patient has a milder effect than the dominant p.Y955C variant.",0
"To determine the rate of depletion and repopulation of mtDNA in the fibroblasts, cells were exposed to EtBr during 8 days and let recover for 12 days (Fig. 1f). EtBr-induced mtDNA depletion occurred at the same rate in all cell lines, C, P, and PPOLG-WT. By contrast, the restoration of mtDNA levels was markedly delayed in P cells, whereas PPOLG-WT showed the same repopulation profile than C cells. These results strongly suggested that the capacity for adequate mtDNA turnover in patient fibroblasts is compromised by the combination of the two recessive POLG mutations. Moreover, they indicate that the treatment with a mitochondrial stressor (EtBr) can unmask the POLG deficient phenotype of the patient.",0
"The effect of the nucleoside analog AZTon the growth of C and P cell lines was next tested. The presence of 10 μM AZT did not have any significant effect on the growth of control cells (C), but significantly reduced the growth of patient fibroblasts after 6, 8, and 10 days in the presence of the drug (Fig. 1g). A second ageand passage-matched control fibroblast cell line (C3) did not show reduced growth either, when exposed to 10 μM AZT (Fig. 1g). This result shows that POLG mutations encountered in the patient make cells more susceptible to the presence of POLG stressors, reinforcing their pathogenic nature.",0
Ceftriaxone exposure induces toxicity in fibroblasts,0
"When C and P cells were exposed to the anesthetic lidocaine, the cellular respiration (O2 consumption) showed the same dose-dependent inhibition in both cell lines (50% inhibition at ~ 4.5 mM) (Fig. 2a). The values were similar to those reported in isolated pig mitochondria [30]. Since we did not detect in vitro inhibition of cellular respiration below 100 μM, and the published concentration of lidocaine with effect on human fibroblast proliferation and viability is above 300 μg/ml [31], much higher than plasma doses [32], a severe impact of this drug in the patient disease progression was excluded.",0
"The addition of ceftriaxone did not inhibited P or C cellular respiration when added to the polarography chamber up to a concentration of 1500 μg/ml (ten times higher than the maximum patient plasma concentration, 141 μg/ml) [32] (Fig. 2b). This excludes a direct effect of the antibiotic on respiratory function. To analyze a longer-term impact, we tested the effect of ceftriaxone on cell growth over 8-day period. Cells were cultured in galactose-based medium to facilitate the detection of defects in oxidative phosphorylation [28]. The growth of patient cells was reduced in the presence of 150 μg/ml ceftriaxone, after 2, 6, or 8 days of treatment when compared with untreated cells. Although this reduction was not statistically significant, it was higher than that for the ageand passage-",0

"matched control cell line (C3) (18% vs. 6% at 8 days) (Fig. 2c). Higher ceftriaxone concentration, 300 μg/ml, caused a higher reduction (42% at 8 days) of P cells, indicating a dose-dependent effect of the drug (Fig. 2c). The number of P cells was significantly reduced when compared with the untreated cells after 2, 6, or 8 days in the presence of 300 μg/ml ceftriaxone, whereas C3 cells were significantly reduced only after 8 days (Fig. 2c). These results indicated higher sensibility of the patient to the drug. Discussion",0
"In the case presented here, a 3-year-old girl experienced severe consciousness level and motor manifestations during the treatment of an infection with Borrelia sp. and was found to have an underlying POLG-related mitochondrial disease. The c.2591A>G; p.Asn864Ser variant was previously reported in heterozygosis in two 15-year-old sisters with mitochondrial disease [ 26 ]. The second variant ( c. 3649 G>C; p.Ala1217Pro) has not been previously associated with disease. Both variants involve highly conserved amino acid residues, which suggest having important functional roles. Proving the pathogenic nature of novel POLG mutations is a major challenge because the POLG locus is highly polymorphic and the disease manifestation is often dependent on epigenetic and environmental factors [5, 7]. POLG-related",1
"diseases are expected to share mtDNA depletion as a common pathogenetic feature, possibly in combination with mtDNA damage including multiple deletions and increased burden of point mutations. However, mtDNA depletion assays can be misleading in the diagnosis because mtDNA copy number is highly variable among different tissues [33] and mtDNA depletion is not always present, especially in the early stages of the disease [34]. Furthermore, in POLG-related epilepsy, myopathy is not a common clinical feature and normal muscle and fibroblast studies do not exclude the diagnosis of POLGrelated mitochondrial disease [35]. Therefore, although quantitative mtDNA depletion was not detected in patient muscle at the time when the clinical symptoms appear, we further evaluated patient POLG performance in cell culture [7]. Patient skin fibroblasts showed delayed rate of mtDNA repopulation after induced depletion, when compared with canonical POLG overexpressing patient cells or with control fibroblasts, an established criterion of pathogenicity [7]. These results indicated that the combination of the two recessive patient variations in POLG polymerase domain is pathogenic. CIV activity reduction was not detected in patient fibroblasts, probably because it lowers only with severe depletion.",0
"There are a few well-established examples of drug-induced mitochondrial disorders. Patients treated with antiviral nucleoside analogs (NRTIs), such as AZT, developed a mitochondrial myopathy characterized by the appearance of ragged-red fibers and cytochrome oxidase–negative fibers [12]. Although",0
"the NRTIs, like AZT, are designed to inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase, its incorporation inhibits mitochondrial pol γ replication inducing mitochondrial toxicity as a major adverse effect. In our in vitro assays, AZT 10 μM had little or no effect on control skin fibroblast proliferation, as published previously [36]. However, the patient POLG mutations facilitated the AZT-induced toxicity and increased 11% the doubling time of the cells. This effect that has been previously described in a cell line with other POLG mutations [13, 14] corroborates the deleterious nature of our patient mutations.",0
"Progression of symptoms and deterioration of mitochondrial disorders in association with an intercurrent illness have been well described [5]. In our patient, IgM anti-Borrelia titers were high suggesting that infection with Borrelia sp. was an important event in the onset of the symptoms of mitochondrial pathology. Interestingly, Borrelia spp. are dependent on purine salvage pathway from the host environment for survival",0
"[37] and therefore could be an additional stress factor for a patient with compromised mtDNA synthesis. In a previous case, the onset of Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) in a young patient appeared in association with Borrelia infection [38]. In other case, a woman with antibodies against Borrelia sp. in serum developed dropped head syndrome (DHS) that was attributed to an underlying multiorgan mitochondriopathy [39]. Remarkably, our patient presented an episode of secondarily generalized focal crisis, hypertonia, and myoclonus of the 4 limbs and Borrelia sp. infection has been frequently associated with myoclonus [40–42].",0
"During her hospital admission, our patient suddenly worsened with the administration of ceftriaxone/lidocaine. Cefalosporin antibiotics, as well as the anesthetic lidocaine, have being previously associated with mitochondrial toxicity. Lidocain inhibits the electron transport chain, although the exact mechanism involved in its cytotoxicity is not well established [30, 43, 44]. The in vitro exposure of patient fibroblasts to lidocaine excluded a severe impact of this drug at the therapeutic dose. The antibiotic treatment, on the contrary, could have been a key environmental factor that worsened the underlying mitochondrial disease of the patient. In our in vitro assays, patient skin fibroblasts were more susceptible to longterm culture in the presence of the drug than controls. More importantly, ceftriaxone and other cephalosporin antibiotics have been associated with serious central nervous system side effects including mainly encephalopathy, convulsion, and myoclonia [45–48].",0
"In summary, we report a clinical case of POLG-related mitochondrial disease hastened by environmental stress, infectious, and therapeutic. This case highlights the importance of early genetic diagnoses of the patients and the necessity of consideration of risks and benefits in the selection of pharmacological treatment for patients with suspected mitochondrial disorders.",0
