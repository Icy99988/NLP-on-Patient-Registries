"Mutations in the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) accumulate in a variety of tissues with age [1]. It has been proposed that these somatic mtDNA mutations play a role in ageing and age-related diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) [2,3]. Recently, it was shown that high levels of deleted mtDNA are present in substantia nigra (SN) neurones from both aged controls and individuals with PD, strengthening the suggestion that somatic mtDNA deletions are involved in the selective neuronal loss observed in brain ageing and in PD [2,4]. To further investigate a possible association between multiple mtDNA deletions and ageing, we performed post mortem examination of the brain from a patient with multiple mtDNA deletions. Multiple mtDNA deletions usually develop secondary to a mutation in one of the enzymes involved in mtDNA maintenance, e.g. polymerase gamma, encoded by the nuclear gene POLG1 [5]. Patients with multiple mtDNA deletions show clinical heterogeneity [6], although in our patient chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) and Parkinsonism were both prominent features.",0
The patient first presented at the age of 22 years with,1
"left-sided ptosis, which slowly progressed over the next 20 years to an almost complete ophthalmoplegia. He developed proximal muscle weakness at age 50 and his first Parkinsonian features at age 51. The features, including rigidity, tremor, bradykinesia and difficulty performing fine motor tasks, were initially unilateral and responded well to dopamine agonists. Aged 54 years, he showed signs of cognitive impairment and increasing dysphagia, dysarthria and dysphonia. His proximal myopathy also became more prominent and there was evidence of sensorimotor neuropathy at age 57. Dopamine agonists became less effective, but he responded well to apomorphine. His dysphagia deteriorated and a PEG tube was inserted because of recurrent aspiration. The patient died aged 59 years because of pneumonia. There was no family history of either mitochondrial disease or PD.",1
"Examination of a post mortem skeletal muscle sample revealed features of mitochondrial myopathy with frequent muscle fibres deficient in the mtDNA-encoded cytochrome c oxidase (COX), some of which were hyperactive for nuclear DNA (nDNA) encoded succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) (Figure 1A). Multiple mtDNA deletions were detected, bothon Southernblot andlong-range PCR assays of total muscle homogenate DNA (Figure 1B). Genetic analysis revealed that the patient was compound heterozygous for mutations in the nDNA-encoded POLG1 gene, coding for thecatalytic subunitof themtDNA-specific polymerase g [7]. These compound heterozygous mutations were c.3311CG (p.S1104C) and c.2542GA (p.G848S).",1
"Macroscopic examination of the brain did not reveal any external abnormalities; however, the SN was almost devoid of pigment throughout. Microscopic examination of the midbrain revealed the extent of SN neuronal loss, which was severe in the lateral group, moderately severe in the middle group and moderately severe in the medial group of the lower midbrain and also uniformly moderate to moderately severe in the upper midbrain. With haematoxylin and eosin stain Lewy bodies (LBs) were seen in the surviving SN neurones (Figure 2A). The red, oculomotor, Edinger-Westphal and dorsal raphe nuclei appeared unaffected. Within the pons there was mild loss of neurones in the locus coeruleus and normal neuronal population density (n.p.d.) within the superior raphe. Within the medulla the n.p.d. of the dorsal nucleus of vagus and of the olivary nuclei were relatively intact. The cerebellum was affected with moderate focal loss of Purkinje cells and focal mild neurone loss in the dentate nucleus. In the basal forebrain the n.p.d. of the nucleus of Meynert appeared intact. Immunohistochemistry using antibodies to alphasynuclein revealed a high proportion of neurones with cytoplasmic immunoreactivity, neurites and immunoreactivity in the neuropil of the SN (Figure 2B) and the nucleus of Meynert. The dorsal nucleus of vagus and the other brainstem and subcortical nuclei showed only mild LB pathology. Fewer than five alpha-synucleinimmunoreactive LBs were present in the anterior cingulate and the frontal cortex but none in the transentorhinal, lateral temporal or parietal cortex. This",1

"Dual COX/SDH histochemistry revealed that 21.2% of the remaining SN neurones were COX-deficient (Figure 2D). This level of COX deficiency is higher than the levels recently observed in the SN of ageing controls (1%) and PD patients (3%) [2]. Immunohistochemistry for the mtDNA-encoded COX subunit I revealed deficiency in individual nigral neurones (Figure 2E), while all nigral neurones showed normal activity for porin, a transmembrane mitochondrial protein used as a reference marker for mitochondrial mass (Figure 2F). From the remaining SN neurones, five pooled, single neurones were laser-microdissected and mtDNA deletion load was assessed using a previously multiplex real-time PCR [9]. The results confirmed high levels of mtDNA deletions in the SN neurones (~65%, n = 5).",1
"Parkinsonism has been previously described in PEO patients with mtDNA deletions [5], as has severe neuronal loss from the SN in patients with multiple mtDNA deletion disorders [10,11]. However, we believe this to be the first report of LB pathology in a patient with Parkinsonism, PEO and multiple mtDNA deletions, secondary to a POLG1",1

(A) Dual histochemistry for the mtDNA-encoded cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and the nDNA-encoded succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) on the patient’s muscle biopsy demonstrates COX-deficient ragged-red fibres (blue) and muscle fibres expressing both COX and SDH (brown). Some freezing artefact is apparent in this muscle sample, but the mitochondrial abnormality is clearly apparent;",1
