"We describe a 16-year-old woman with a rare POLG1 A467T/W748S genotype, with a wide range of neurological manifestations, including focal parieto-occipital lobe seizures, migraine headaches, cerebellar ataxia, sensory– motor axonal neuropathy, and impairment of visual perception and cognitive function. Treatment of epilepsy in patients with a POLG1 compound heterozygous A467T/W748S genotype is very challenging; the epilepsy may preferentially respond to sodium channel blockers. The POLG1-related syndrome has a variable clinical course, and disease morbidity and mortality may be correlated with the genotype.",1
"© 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Introduction The POLG1 gene mutation is a commonly reported gene defect identiﬁed in autosomal recessive mitochondrial DNA depletion disorders [1]. POLG1 gene, located on chromosome 15q25, encodes for the 140-kDa catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase γ, which is responsible for mitochondrial DNA replication [1]. DNA polymerase γ also consists of a",0
"55-kDa accessory subunit, which is encoded by the POLG2 gene on chromosome 17q23–24, and is responsible for tight binding to doublestranded DNA [2]. The POLG1 gene mutation was identiﬁed as a genetic substrate in Alpers’ disease [3], which was described in the early 1930s by Bernard Alpers as diffuse progressive degeneration of the gray matter in children [4]. Since that time many more POLG1 genotypes causing Alpers’ disease have been discovered [5]. More than 150 different homozygous and heterozygous POLG1 mutations have been reported in the literature [2,4,6–8]. They have variable phenotypes, clinical spectra, and natural histories, which depend on the speciﬁc POLG1 gene mutation. Mitochondrial disorders can have a very insidious clinical course, which can make the diagnosis difﬁcult, especially if the genetic workup for routinely tested mitochondrial disorders is negative. Treatment of epilepsy in patients with POLG1 gene mutations, speciﬁcally the compound heterozygous A467T/W748S genotype, is very challenging, and the epilepsy may selectively respond to only certain antiepileptic drugs [7].",0

"A 16-year-old right-handed woman, who was an ex-preemie (gestational age=36 weeks) born to nonconsanguineous parents, developed over a 1-year period progressively worsening focal seizures refractory to multiple antiepileptic drugs. The patient had daily seizures of different semiology, signifying the multifocality of her seizures. The ﬁrst was a focal motor seizure, with right face, arm, and leg twitching infrequently evolving into convulsions. The second type was a visual sensory seizure which was described as either a right homonymous hemianopsia or colored spheres in the right visual ﬁeld, and the third type of seizure was a somatosensory seizure of spreading numbness and tingling sensation on the right side of the body. She was refractory to oxcarbazepine, levetiracetam, and zonisamide, at which point topiramate was started but the patient developed cognitive side effects and, therefore, topiramate was discontinued. Valproic acid was initiated which made the patient's cognitive symptoms and seizures worse, at which time the patient was brought to Thomas Jefferson University epilepsy monitoring unit with focal status epilepticus for video/EEG (VEEG) monitoring.",1
"On admission, VEEG demonstrated multiple focal somatosensory and visual seizures, without impairment of consciousness. The majority of the seizures emanated from the left parietal (P3) region with a tendency to spread within the ipsilateral hemisphere (Fig. 1). Few seizures emanated from the left posterior temporal (T5) region, and most of those showed no spread to the other leads. Interictally the 1525-5050/$ – see front matter © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In addition to seizures, the patient also had frequent migraine headaches which were often preceded by a visual aura, making it difﬁcult to differentiate the migraine aura from a visual sensory seizure. Nonneurological chronic symptoms included palpitations with a baseline heart rate of 120 bpm and abdominal discomfort with irregular bowel movements.",1

"Cranial nerve examination was noteworthy for downbeat and horizontal nystagmus, ocular dysmetria, right homonymous hemianopsia, bilateral tilted and atrophic optic nerves, and a mild right central facial nerve palsy, with the rest of the cranial nerves being grossly intact.

Sensation was diminished to pain, temperature, vibration, and proprioception in all four extremities. On coordination testing the patient was unable to perform ﬁnger-to-nose or heel-to-shin and had a positive Romberg sign.

"multisystemic involvement, a mitochondrial cytopathy was suspected, though the differential also included cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM), autosomal dominant ataxias, leukodystrophy, and paraneoplastic disorder, as well as diseases of infectious, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative etiology. Valproate was immediately switched to phenytoin and 10% dextrose intravenously with L-carnitine and coenzyme Q-10 was started, which resulted in rapid resolution of the epileptic status and subsequent improvement of the patient's neurological function. Diagnostic workup in addition to scalp VEEG monitoring included: comprehensive blood and spinal ﬂuid testing (Table 1), neuroimaging, echocardiogram, muscle biopsy, genetic testing for mitochondrial disorders, such as mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS), myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red ﬁbers (MERRF), and genetic testing for CADASIL and FHM. All laboratory tests (Table 1), except for the high serum pyruvate and lactate levels, low vitamin B12 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, brain MRI, and EEG, were normal. MRI of the brain (Fig. 2) revealed T2 hyperintensities in the left thalamus, left parietal and left occipital cortical regions, and right cerebellar white matter, with corresponding restricted diffusion on DWI, as well as associated atrophy of the left parieto-occipital lobe. Over a period of several months, the hyperintense lesions on the MRI resolved, which correlated with improvement of the patient's seizures and neurological function. The patient was discharged from the epilepsy monitoring unit after her seizures had stopped and she was periodically followed in the outpatient clinic.",1
