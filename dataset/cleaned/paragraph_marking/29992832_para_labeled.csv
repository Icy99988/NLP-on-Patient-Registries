"Human ovarian dysfunction comprises a variety of different conditions that each result in irregular menstrual cycles, ovarian failure, and female infertility. Amenorrhea and irregular menstrual cycles are two main features of ovarian dysfunction. Genetic defects can cause ovarian dysfunction, including chromosomal abnormalities and single gene alterations1–7. Mutations in STAG3, BMP15, FSHR, GDF9, NOBOX, MCM8,",0
"MCM9, NUP107, MSH4, CSB-PGBD3 and MSH5 can cause recessive primary amenorrhea8–17 or secondary amenorrhea18–20. Sequence variants in POLG, NR5A1, KHDRBS1, and NOBOX are reported to be associated with dominant primary21 or secondary amenorrhea22–24. In our clinical practice, some patients exhibit irregular menstrual cycles and poor outcomes of in vitro fertilization, but there is a lack of knowledge of the potential genetic contribution to this ovarian dysfunction. In this study, we examined a patient from a consanguin-",1
"eous family exhibiting irregular menstrual cycles and abnormal oocytes. Using whole-exome sequencing technology, we identified a novel homozygous POLG mutation in this patient. In contrast to previously reported heterozygous POLG mutations associated with premature ovarian failure (POF), this is the first recessive mode of inheritance of a POLG mutation in a patient with ovarian dysfunction. Materials and methods Patient",1
"A Chinese patient with ovarian dysfunction was recruited from The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, and was from a consanguineous family (Figure 1A). The patient did not show any of the following: karyotypic abnormalities, autoimmune disorders, history of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, or pelvic surgery. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Anhui Medical University. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient and her parents, and 5 ml of peripheral blood was collected from the patient.",1

"Exome sequence capture was performed using the SureSelect Human All Exon V5 Kit (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The captured libraries were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 Sequencer. Sequence reads were mapped against a human reference genome (hg19) using the BurrowsWheeler Aligner algorithm (http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/). The SNPs and Indels were detected by SAMtools (http://samtools.sourceforge.net/). Sanger sequencing was performed using gene-specific primers. Results Clinical characterization",0
"The proband (II-1, Figure 1A) was diagnosed with ovarian dysfunction and infertility at 32 years of age in 2017. Her height was 160 cm and weight was 60 kg. She experienced menarche at 15 years of age. Her menstrual cycle was irregular from 24 years of age, when she had a cycle length of approximately 4 months. Both ovaries were not clearly detected by transvaginal color Doppler ultrasound at the first-time consultancy. Circulating hormone levels of the proband were: 10.48 IU/l follicle stimulating hormone (FSH);",1
"2.77 IU/l luteinizing hormone (LH); 2.07 nmol/l testosterone; 54 pmol/l estradiol (E2); 10.03 ng/ml prolactin; and 0.05 ng/ml anti-Mu€llerian hormone (AMH). Magnetic resonance imaging showed the pituitary was normal. Examination revealed no progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), sensory ataxic neuropathy dysarthria, ophthalmoparesis, mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 4A, Leigh syndrome, or spinocerebellar ataxia with epilepsy. The proband’s mother (I-2) underwent menopause at the age of 54.",0
"To adjust the menstrual cycle and improve ovarian function, this patient had undergone 3 years of irregular hormone replacement therapy. Prior to ovarian stimulation in our hospital, 3 months of androgen supplement (dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) 25 mg three times a day) and regular hormone therapy (oral contraceptive: ethinylestradiol and cyproterone acetate tablets (Diane-35); for 21 days of each month) were used as an intervention method. Hormone levels were measured in duplicate: 7.46 IU/l FSH; 1.12 IU/l LH; and 33.43 pmol/l E2. No follicular development was detected in the subsequent three cycles using letrozole tablets (Furui; Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceutical Co, Lianyungang, China). The patient then received a constantly adjusted injection dose of menotropins (hMG; Lizhu Pharmaceutical Co, Zhuhai, China) but produced only one oocyte. Details and endpoints of the treatment are shown in Table 1.",0
"The pretreatment with DHEA and hormone replacement lowered the circulating FSH level, improved the ovarian sensitivity to FSH and increased the opportunity for oocyte development. The long stimulation lasted for about 1 month; one follicle about 20 x 17 mm could be detected on the left ovary. The only oocyte was retrieved from the left ovary by transvaginal ultrasound-guided puncture, approximately 36 h after induction of ovulation with 5000 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG; Lizhu Pharmaceutical Co.). After denuding the oocyte from surrounding granular cells using hyaluronidase, the abnormal presence of two polar bodies and granular cytoplasm (Figure 1B) indicated poor oocyte quality. Despite the aberrant morphology, the oocyte underwent intracytoplasmic sperm injection in vitro, but displayed complete fertilization failure.",1
Molecular genetic analysis,0
"Whole-exome sequencing with aligned sequence reads variant identification were performed, as previously described23. Pedigree analysis suggested an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance associated with this family (Figure 1A). We filtered out polymorphisms with allele frequencies >1% in The Short Genetic Variations database (dbSNP), 1000 Genomes (1000G), Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC), and Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) databases. A list of genes harboring coding/splicing homozygous variants were further filtered by the functional impact of the mutation (e.g. conservation and functional prediction by in silico prediction modules PolyPhen2, SIFT, and Mutationtaster).",0
"One homozygous POLG mutation (NM_002693:exon18: c.2890C > T: p.R964C) passed the filtering steps. This mutation was segregated within the family (Figure 2A). The POLG gene encodes a DNA polymerase-c involved in the replication of human mitochondrial DNA25. Mutations in POLG can cause POF or premature menopause, and all cases to date showed dominant inheritance22,26–28. Our study found the first POLG homozygous mutation in a patient with ovarian dysfunction. In silico analysis by five online prediction tools suggested that the p.R964C mutation was pathogenic CLIMACTERIC 469",1

"(Table 2). The mutation was also predicted a high risk for pathogenicity using the POLG Pathogenicity Prediction Server (http://polg.bmb.msu.edu/query.php). Amino acid R964 is located in the polymerase domain of POLG, and is highly conserved among different species ranging from human to zebrafish (Figure 2B), suggesting the functional importance of the R964 site. Discussion",0
"In this study, we report that a novel homozygous POLG mutation is associated with ovarian dysfunction in a patient with consanguineous pedigree. The POLG gene encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase-c involved in the replication of mitochondrial DNA25. Polg knock-out mice develop an mtDNA mutator phenotype associated with reduced",0
"lifespan, premature onset of aging-related phenotypes and reduced fertility29. Dominant or recessive mutations in human POLG can cause a spectrum of disorders associated with mitochondria dysfunction, including PEO, sensory ataxic neuropathy, familial Parkinsonism and progressive sclerosing poliodystrophy30–32. Most women with PEO exhibit early menopause26. The heterozygous p.Y955C, p.R943H, p.Y831C and p.S511N mutations of POLG can segregate with POF and PEO22,26,28,33,34. In addition, another heterozygous p.Y951N mutation in POLG was found in a patient with cataracts, early-onset distal muscle weakness and atrophy, ovarian dysgenesis (a severe form of POF) and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria27. Another study screened POLG mutations in 201 patients with spontaneous primary ovarian insufficiency and found one heterozygous p.R953C variant in a patient35. Therefore, POLG heterozygous mutations, including p.S511N, p.Y831C, p.R943H, p.Y951N, p.R953C, and p.Y955C, may be associated with syndromic or non-syndromic ovarian failure.",0
Previous studies have identified dominant POLG mutations,0
"in patients with ovarian failure. However, using pedigree and WES analysis, we have found the first homozygous POLG mutation in a patient with non-syndromic ovarian dysfunction, suggesting a recessive mode of mutation inheritance. The functional difference between the p.R964C mutation and previously reported heterozygous POLG mutations remains to be determined. However, as our reported case manifested as a non-syndromic ovarian dysfunction phenotype (a mild form compared with POF), we speculate that p.R964C produces a milder functional defect in POLG activity than the six abovementioned mutations. Further experiments are required to directly examine this proposal.",1
"Our study demonstrates, for the first time, that a novel biallelic POLG mutation (p.R964C) may cause ovarian dysfunction. This study expands our understanding of POLG mutations related to ovarian dysfunction, and the mode of inheritance of certain sequence variants. The information provided by this study may also assist in future genetic counseling and precision medicine approaches. Authors’ contributions",1
