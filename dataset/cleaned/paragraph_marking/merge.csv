"In contrast, parkinsonism has been reported in several patients with PEO and multiple mtDNA deletions in muscle due to mutations in POLG1. The largest series included seven families from Finland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, and the clinical picture was characterized by PEO, parkinsonism, and premature menopause.9 Transmission was autosomal recessive in one family and autosomal dominant in all others. We have also described a US family with autosomal dominant PEO, neuropathy, hypogonadism, and parkinsonism.20 There are several interesting differences between the patients in these families and the two sisters described here. First, all other patients had PEO, which had invariably preceded the appearance of parkinsonism by several years. Second, the age at onset of parkinsonism ranged from 36 to 75 years in the European families and was 46 years in the US patient, whereas both sisters described here started showing parkinsonian symptoms in their 20’s. Interestingly, the age at onset was younger (36 – 46 years) in the one European family with autosomal recessive inheritance, and those patients were, similar to ours, compound heterozygotes for POLG mutations. Third, parkinsonism was part of complex syndromes in previous reports, whereas the only major additional clinical feature in our patients was peripheral neuropathy. As a consequence, these two sisters presented as juvenile PD, leading us to suspect PINK1 mutations before sequencing POLG, a step that was motivated by the coexistence of peripheral neuropathy and by presence of RRFs and multiple",0

Of particular inter­ est are mutations in the mtDNA polymerase ')' (POLGl) gene, which are associated with a pheno­ typic spectrum ranging from Alpers syndrome to re­ cessive ataxia and late-onset progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO).2•5 We describe a patient with strokelike episodes typical of MELAS due to mutation of POLGl.",0

"Discussion. Our patient's clinical presentation (strokelike episode with occipital localization, headache, and seizures) and laboratory investiga­ tions (elevated CSF lactate, ragged-red fibers) fulfill the diagnostic criteria for MELAS. 1 The presence of COX-deficient fibers (although unusual in MELAS) and the absence of typical mtDNA point mutations prompted further investigations. Both long-range PCR and real-time PCR analyses detected multiple mtDNA deletions, confirming that low levels of multiple mtDNA deletions may sometimes remain undetected by Southern blot analysis3•4",1
"Sequencing of the POLGl gene identified com­ pound heterozygous mutations, consistent with the negative family history and indicative of autosomal recessive inheritance. Both mutations have been re­ ported previously as recessive mutations, although not together; the R627Q mutation has been docu­ mented in patients with PEO and sensory ataxia, and Alpers syndrome, whereas the G848S mutation has been reported in patients with either PEO or Alpers syndrome (http://dir-apps.niehs.nih.gov/polg/).",0
"Although POLGl mutations are widely de­ scribed in patients with encephalopathy, typical strokelike episodes are unusual, although there is a report of an ataxic patient with the A467T mutation whose 17-year-old sister had acute encephalopathy and seizures followed by cortical blindness and stu­ por, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, and sudden death.3 In other patients with POLGl mutations, cerebral lesions in the occipital lobes similar to MELAS were observed, but strokelike-episodes were not report­ ed.4•5 Many of these patients presented with epilepsy and headache typically observed during strokelike",0

"Alpers syndrome is a fatal neurogenetic disorder caused by the mutations in POLG1 gene encoding the mitochondrial DNA polymerase c (polc). Two missense variants, c.248T > C (p.L83P), c.2662G > A (p.G888S) in POLG1 were detected in a 10-yearold Chinese girl with refractory seizures, acute liver failure after exposure to valproic acid, cortical blindness, and psychomotor regression. The pathology of left occipital lobe showed neuronal loss, spongiform degeneration, astrocytosis, and demyelination. In addition, there were prominent white matter changes in a series of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and increased immunological factors in CSF.",1

"Alpers syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive hepatocerebral syndrome characterized by intractable seizures, early onset progressive liver dysfunction leading to hepatic failure, psychomotor regression (OMIM#203700) [1,2]. The disease manifestation is usually in early childhood and progress to death [1]. Naviaux et al. ﬁrst demonstrated the deﬁciency of mitochondrial DNA polymerase c activity and mitochondria DNA (mtDNA) depletion in the muscle and liver tissue of a patient with Alpers syndrome [3]. Mutations in POLG1 gene have also been reported to be responsible for autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant forms of progressive external ophthalmoplegia,",0

"healthy and developed normally until 9 years of age. Her school performance was below average. At 9 years of age, she developed multifocal partial seizures. The seizures usually generalized and progressed to status epilepticus. Serials EEGs showed slow activity and almost continuous spike wave over the central, parietal, and occipital regions of both hemispheres. She was treated with phenobarbital, carbamazepine, topiramate, vaproic acid (VPA), lamotrigine, and clonazepam. However, the seizures could not be controlled. VPA was used for 2 and half months and then was terminated due to acute liver failure. She developed edema and coagulopathy 52 days after starting VPA treatment. The investigation of the coagulative function at that time revealed decreased ﬁbrinogen (1.56 g/L, normal range: 2.00– 4.00 g/L). Three weeks later she developed jaundice and hepatomegaly. Liver function studies showed abnormalities of alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, total protein, albumin, and ﬁbrinogen with values of 64 l/L (normal range: 0–40 l/L), 215 l/L (normal range: 0–45 l/L),",1
"145.6 lmol/L (normal range: 1.7–20 lmol/L), 113.1 lmol/L (normal range: 0–6 lmol/L), 44.35 g/L (normal range: 60–82 g/L), 28.8 g/L (normal range: 35–50 g/L), and 0.64 g/L, respectively. VPA treatment was stopped. The liver function improved and was near normal 6 months later.",0
"Seven months after the onset of the disease, the patient developed episodes of visual loss. In the ﬁrst two episodes, the vision recovered several days later. However, the visual loss persisted after the third episode. The simultaneous MRI showed high T2 and DWI signals in the occipital region (Fig. 1C). Visual evoked potentials were absent. The vision problem appeared to be cortical in origin. The patient developed psychomotor regression gradually. She could not walk and sit without support 4 months after the onset of the disease. Nine months after the onset of disease, she lost language and had poor response to commands. She had been in vegetative state since 1 year after the onset of the disease. Her symptoms did not respond to the treatment of intraveously immunoglobulin (2 g/kg), corticosteroids, as well as the above mentioned antiepileptic drugs.",1
"Biochemical studies including lactate, pyruvate, and ammonia were normal. Plasma amino acids and urine organic acids were normal. CSF was investigated 8 times from the beginning of the disease to 13 months after the onset. The CSF was acellular but the protein concentration increased every time from 1.99 g/L to 2.28 g/L (normal range: 0.15–0.45 g/L). CSF glucose was normal.

Hearing threshold of left and right ear was 50 dB and 30 dB, respectively. Nerve conduct velocity studies showed decreased sensory and motor nerve conduct velocity. Sensory nerve conduct velocity of sural nerve and median nerve was 37 m/s and 39.3 m/s, respectively (normal value > 50 m/s). The motor nerve conduct velocity of common peroneal nerve was 40.3 m/s (normal value > 45 m/s).",1
"Several brain MRIs were performed (Fig. 1). The brain MRIs showed increased T2 and ﬂair signals in hemioval central white matter and cerebellar white matter at 2 days and 3 months after the onset of the disease (Fig. 1A and B), and 7 months later, brain MRI showed that the abnormal signal in white matter was more extensive (Fig. 1C1). Increased T2 and ﬂair signals in the right occipital region (Fig. 1C2) and increased DWI signal in both occipital regions were observed (Fig. 1C3). No enhancement was found in the contrast-enhanced brain MRI at 9 months after disease onset. One month later, MRI revealed diﬀuse brain atrophy, and the increased T2 signal in the white matter was further extensive (Fig. 1D).",0
"Pathology studies of muscle, peripheral nerve, and brain biopsy were performed. Gastrocnemius muscle biopsy was unremarkable, no ragged-red-ﬁber was found in the Gomori–Trichrome stain. Sural nerve biopsy showed damaged axon and myelin (Fig. 2). Left occipital lobe biopsy showed astrocytosis, neuronal loss and sponginess in the cortex and partial demyelination, gliosis, and vacuolization in white matter (Fig. 3).

Because of the intractable seizures and liver failure that are consistent with hepatocerebral mtDNA depletion syndrome, sequencing of coding exons of deoxyguanosine kinase (DGUOK) and DNA polymerase c1 (POLG1) was performed [15–17]. Deleterious mutations were not detected in DGUOK. However, two novel heterozygous missense variants, c.248T > C (p.L83P), c.2662G > A (p.G888S) were",1
"detected in POLG1 gene. Sequence analysis of parental blood DNA revealed that her father carried L83P and her mother carried G888S (Fig. 4). These two novel missense variants occurred at highly conserved amino acid residues (Fig. 5). The mitochondrial DNA copy number in muscle was examined by real time quantitative PCR [18], and was found to be about 70% of age-matched mean. Discussion",1
"This 10-year-old girl presented with focal, multifocal, and generalized seizures, which were uncontrollable by various antiepileptic medicines. After the administration of VPA, the patient developed acute liver failure. The clinical course was likely to be the Alpers syndrome. The axonopathy in peripheral sensory nerve biopsy and the pathology of brain occipital lobe including the neuronal loss, spongiform degeneration, astrocytosis were similar to those described in Alpers syndrome [6,19,20]. Hearing loss is a common clinical feature reported to be associated with mitochondrial DNA disorders, but it is less frequent in patients with Alpers syndrome.",1
"Fig. 4. Two novel heterozygous missense variants. c.248T > C (p.L83P), c.2662G > A (p.G888S) were detected in DNA polymerase gamma1 (POLG1). These two missense variants inherited from her father and mother, respectively. The mitochondrial DNA polymerase c is required for the replication and repair of the 16,569-bp of human mitochondrial genome. It has been reported that the mutant catalytic subunit POLG1 containing the most common mutation, A467T, possesses only 4% of the wild-type DNA polymerase activity due to its failure to interact with the accessory subunit, POLG2, which",1
"stimulates the polymerase activity [21]. MtDNA depletion and multiple deletions have been found in muscle or liver tissues from patients with Alpers syndrome [6,11]. In our case, the mitochondrial DNA content in muscle was found to be about 70% of age-matched mean. This is not a dramatic reduction. Unfortunately, liver specimen was not available for analysis. Reduction in mtDNA content causes reduced synthesis of all respiratory chain complexes containing mtDNA-encode subunits leading to generalized deﬁciency in mitochondrial respiratory chain function. Nevertheless, the blood and CSF lactate levels, the pathology and histochemistry of muscle, and the mtDNA copy number in muscle could be normal in some patients, especially in the early stage of the disease [6,7,11,20].",0
"More than 83 POLG1 mutations have been recorded in the Human DNA Polymerase Gamma Mutation Database (http://dir-apps.niehs.nih.gov/polg/). Most of them are missense mutations. The most common A467T mutation accounts for approximately 40% of the POLG1 mutant alleles described in Alpers syndrome [22–25]. Other recurrent mutations include W748S, G848S, and T914P. Most of the remaining mutations occur only once [6,7,11,22]. Two novel mutations c.248T > C (p.L83P) and c.2662G > A (p.G888S) were",0
"identiﬁed in our patient. The L83 is located in between the polyQ stretch and the beginning of the exonuclease domain, an area of no known function, but appears to be very well conserved from yeast to man (http:// dir-apps.niehs.nih.gov/polg/) [21]. The G888 is an absolutely conserved amino acid found in motif A of the polymerase domain. It is two residues away from a critical Asp (D890) residue which makes up one of three carboxylic amino acids (triad) to chelate the two magnesium ions at the active site. Mutation at the neighboring residue, A889T, is found in autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia with an early age of presentation. These patients also appear to have ataxia. On the other side, the T885S is associated with Alpers",0

The two novel amino acid substitutions are highly conserved among diﬀerent species. syndrome (http://dir-apps.niehs.nih.gov/polg/). Thus, although the pathogenicity of these two novel missense variants has not been directly proven, it is most likely that they are responsible for the clinical course of this patient. In addition, the asymptomatic parents were conﬁrmed to be carriers of each of the mutations.",0
"Alpers syndrome is known as a neurodegenerative disease aﬀecting mainly the gray matter. However in this case, MRI showed symmetric abnormal signals in bilateral cerebral and cerebellar white matter during the course of the disease. Demyelination and gliosis were also found in the biopsy of white matter. Although MRI and pathological changes in the white matter have been reported in Alpers syndrome [6,20,26], such remarkable white matter changes were unprecedented. Whether this phenotype correlated with the genotype in the Chinese ethnic background is not clear.",0
"Immunological studies in Alpers syndrome have never been reported. In our patient, the CSF showed positive oligo-clone bands, very high IgG synthesis rate, and IgG index throughout the entire course of the disease. These laboratory ﬁndings made the diagnosis of inﬂammatory demyelinative disease initially considered. However, the patient did not respond to the treatment with 2 g/kg IVIG, and 20 mg/kg methylprednisolone daily for 3 days with oral prednisone taper. Thus, the diagnosis of inﬂammatory demyelinative disease was unlikely. The immunological abnormality may be secondary to the brain damage. Whether it plays a role in the disease progression does need further investigation. Mutations in POLG1 can cause a broad spectrum of clinical disease [12,27]. Even among the patients of Alpers syndrome, the clinical manifestations may be variable. This Chinese case demonstrated that the white matter may also be severely involved in Alpers syndrome. In addition, the immunological reactions may",0

"Alpers disease is typically a disease of childhood, and it may not be given sufficient attention in juvenile cases. We describe a 17-year-old adolescent girl with clinical, electroencephalographic, pathologic, and biochemical features of Alpers disease caused by mutations in POLG1 and suggest that this diagnosis be considered in adults with encephalopathy or intractable epilepsy, especially with liver disease. In these patients, mutational analysis of POLG1 is mandatory.",1
"A 17-year-old adolescent girl of New Zealand, European, and Pacific Island ethnicity was initially seen with clusters of occipital seizures characterized by a brief visual disturbance followed by head extension, clonic jerking of the right arm, and secondary generalization. An initial electroencephalogram demonstrated diffuse slowing. Handwriting had always been difficult, to the extent that she needed a stenographer to write some final examinations. Mild clumsiness and pes cavus had worsened during the previous 2 years. Nerve conduction studies showed peripheral neuropathy. Developmental milestones were otherwise normal, and she had normal intelligence. Her vision and hearing were also normal. Pregnancy and delivery had been unremarkable, and her height and weight were consistently between the third and tenth percentiles. At age 5 years, she had viral meningitis (coxsackievirus B2 cultured from cerebrospinal fluid). The cerebrospinal fluid at this stage had a low glucose level (25 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555]) and a significantly elevated protein level (0.57 g/dL [to con-",1

She made a full recovery. She began experiencing migraines at age 12 years, with visual aura and vomiting.",1
"Family history showed that a maternal aunt, currently aged 48 years, had an undiagnosed neurologic condition, with delayed early milestones and ataxia beginning at age 3 years. She regressed neurologically between ages 5 and 7 years, with subsequent severe intellectual disability. A maternal uncle died at age 3 months of “cot death.”",0
"The patient was treated early with midazolam hydrochloride followed by maintenance therapy with phenytoin sodium. She had a cluster of seizures after 1 month, remained seizure-free for 4 months, and then developed status epilepticus. During the next 2 months, she had repeated admissions to the intensive care unit with status epilepticus or encephalopathy. Although she had lucid periods between episodes, overall she developed stepwise deterioration, with memory impairment, slurred speech, and left-sided hemiparesis. A variety of anticonvulsant agents, including carbamazepine, valproate sodium, lamotrigine, intravenous benzodiazepines, topiramate, gabapentin, and intermittent doses of phenobarbital sodium, were tried without sustained benefit. Liver function test results became abnormal while the patient was taking carbamazepine and before valproate therapy: peak alanine aminotransferase, 396 U/L (reference range, 7-28 U/L) (to convert to microkatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167); peak 'Y-glutamyltransferase, 1234 U/L (reference range, 7-36 U/L) (to convert to microkatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167); and peak aspartate aminotransferase, 322 U/L (reference range, 12-27",1
"U/L) (to convert to microkatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167). Liver dysfunction persisted when valproate therapy was commenced but deteriorated when the patient received multiple drugs, including antituberculous therapy. Subsequent electroencephalograms showed frequent epileptiform discharges in the left posterior quadrant and continued diffuse slowing. Magnetic resonance imaging findings were initially normal but showed progressive abnormality with increased signal on T2weighted images in the cortical and subcortical white matter and basal ganglia (Figure 1). The cerebrospinal fluid showed persistently low glucose levels (11-65 mg/dL) and elevated protein levels (0.11-0.47 g/dL), with few lymphocytes. Lactic acidosis (lactate levels of 61-110 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.111]) was noted during the 2 weeks before death. Urinalysis showed generalized aminoaciduria and normal organic acid levels. Biopsies of the skin, muscle, and liver were nondiagnostic. Brain biopsy showed slight perivascular lymphocytic cuffing, perhaps representing cerebral angiitis.",1
"A variety of infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic processes were considered. The patient received empirical therapy for these conditions (immunosuppression, antibiotics, and therapy for tuberculosis), without any improvement. Consultation with a pediatric neurologist suggested the possibility of a mitochondrial disorder. She commenced a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet and multivitamin therapy, with no improvement. Her neurologic decline continued, and she died at age 17 years 9 months of respiratory failure secondary to her neurologic condition. At autopsy, the brain showed extensive neuronal loss and gliosis, most prominent in the occipital lobes (Figure 2B), as typically seen in Alpers disease, but also in the basal ganglia and brainstem. The liver showed extensive steatosis and fresh necrosis (Figure 2A). Respiratory chain enzyme analysis and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction for estimation of mtDNA content, performed on a muscle biopsy sample as described previously,8,11 showed normal activities of complexes I, II, II+III, III, and IV and of mitochondrial marker enzyme citrate synthase. In the liver (post mortem), there was marked deficiency of the respiratory chain enzymes containing subunits encoded by mtDNA (residual activities of 8% for complex I, 33% for complex III, and 19% for complex IV), with normal activity of the nuclear-encoded complex II (101%) and elevated activ-",1
"ity of citrate synthase (316%). Sequencing of the entire mitochondrial genome in the liver DNA did not reveal any pathogenic mutations. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed that the ratio of mtDNA to nuclear DNA in the liver was deficient (0.17; mean [SD] of 6 control livers, 1.01 [0.15]; range, 0.78-1.19).",0
"The POLG1 gene was screened by direct sequencing as described previously8 and was found to harbor 2 compound heterozygous missense mutations. The first mutation, A2551G in exon 16, predicts the substitution of a conserved threonine by an alanine at position 851 (T851A) (Figure 3A). The second mutation, C3139T in exon 20, changes a conserved arginine to a tryptophan at position 1047 (R1047W) (Figure 3B). These mutations are assumed to be pathogenic because they are",1

"Alpers disease is characterized by childhood encephalopathy and hepatopathy due to mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency. Some adults with Alpers disease have been described but have not been studied at the molecular level.14,15 Mutations in POLG1 were first identified as a cause of Alpers disease by Naviaux and Nguyen,6 and recent studies7,8,16 have confirmed this association, showing that deficiency of polymerase 'Y is the most common autosomal recessive cause of Alpers disease in children. The present data suggest that mutations in POLG1 are also involved in juvenile Alpers disease.",0
"The pattern of respiratory chain abnormality in the proband (complex I and IV deficiency) and the family history of a maternal aunt with neurologic regression and ataxia led to the initial consideration of mtDNA mutations. However, sequencing of the whole mitochondrial genome excluded this possibility. Finding mutations in POLG1 enabled us to also test the aunt, who carries neither mutation, indicating that her neurologic problems are unrelated. Confirmation of autosomal recessive (rather than maternal) inheritance has facilitated genetic counseling.",0
"Mutations in POLG1 were originally associated with autosomal dominant or recessive familial progressive external ophthalmoplegia12,17 and multiple mtDNA rearrangements (particularly deletions) in postmitotic tissues. In addition, mutations in POLG1 can cause sensory ataxic neuropathy with dysarthria and ophthalmoplegia18 (of note, the present patient also had a peripheral neuropathy) and an ataxic syndrome without progressive external ophthalmoplegia.19 Alpers disease is associated with depletion of mtDNA in the liver.8,20 Thus, mutations in this gene can have various consequences for mtDNA and variously affect different tissues.21",0

Mitochondrial disorders should be considered at any age, particularly when multiple organ systems are involved. In conclusion, Alpers disease should be considered in adults with encephalopathy and intractable epilepsy, particularly when the liver or other organs are involved. Mutation screening of POLG1 should be considered in such patients and is vital for identifying the underlying cause and for genetic counseling.",0

"of ‘‘progressive degeneration of gray matter’’ in an infant with a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative illness.1 However, it was Huttenlocher who later recognised the clinical syndrome of psychomotor retardation, intractable epilepsy and liver failure.2 Explosive onset of seizures (generalised, focal and myoclonic) usually occurs between the ages of 1 and 3 years and patients frequently present in status epilepticus or with epilepsia partialis continua. In many cases the onset of this intractable epilepsy heralds an inexorable and rapid decline resulting in death within months. In addition to the pre-terminal hepatic failure, there are a number of other associated clinical features including developmental delay and regression, hypotonia, cortical blindness, ataxia and in older patients an axonal sensory neuropathy. Although the molecular aetiology of this disease was initially unclear, it has now become apparent that almost all infants and young children with AlpersHuttenlocher disease have a disorder of oxidative phosphorylation secondary to depletion of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Mutations in three genes (POLG1, DGOUK and MPV17) are responsible for most cases of hepatocerebral mtDNA depletion, but interestingly, only mutations in POLG1 have been associated with AlpersHuttenlocher disease, epilepsy not being a feature of mutations in either DGOUK or MPV17.3 4 Administration of the anti-convulsant drug sodium valproate has been associated with a fatal hepatopathy,5 and it has been suggested that young children with Alpers-Huttenlocher disease may be at increased risk of this complication.6 In these patients discontinuation of sodium valproate has not been associated with an improved clinical course in this fatal condition. Although the mutations identified in our patient have previously been reported as part of a study of the phenotypic presentation of POLG mutations,7 this is the first description of the case and discussion of the important clinical points it raises regarding the investigation and treatment of children with liver failure precipitated by sodium valproate treatment.",0
"kg/day. Almost 2 months after commencing this drug he became unwell with persistent vomiting and encephalopathy and was admitted to hospital. His GCS on admission was 3 and his blood sugar unrecordable. He had deranged liver function tests, prolonged clotting, elevated ammonia, and a high plasma lactate (14.8 mmol/l). Sodium valproate was stopped and supportive therapy instituted. He regained normal consciousness after several hours, although plasma lactate remained elevated at",1
"7.9 mmol/l. Brain MRI scan showed abnormal white matter signal in the occipital and medial temporal lobes bilaterally (fig 1A), findings which persisted on a follow-up scan 15 months later (fig 1B). Hepatic dysfunction progressed (table 1), but the child was considered unsuitable for liver transplantation at this time because of a presumptive diagnosis of Alpers-Huttenlocher disease. With conservative management and vitamin K supplementation, his liver function returned to normal over a 6-month period. His epilepsy is currently treated with levetiracetam and seizures are infrequent. In view of the high lactate, seizures and hepatic dysfunction, mitochondrial disease was considered and a muscle biopsy was performed. Blood DNA was investigated for mutations in POLG1.",1
METHODS,0
"Standard histological and histochemical (including sequential cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)) analyses were performed on frozen sections (10 mm) of skeletal muscle biopsy obtained from the patient’s left quadriceps. The activities of individual respiratory chain complexes and the matrix marker citrate synthase were determined as previously described.8 Total genomic DNA was extracted from several tissues by standard procedures. Rearrangements of mtDNA were investigated by Southern blot analysis and long-range PCR of skeletal muscle DNA. Sequencing of the entire coding region and adjacent intronic regions of POLG1 was performed on blood DNA using a fluorescent chain terminating sequencing kit (Applied Biosciences, Foster",0

City, CA) and a fluorescent DNA analyser (primers and conditions available online, Applied Biosciences 3100). The sequence obtained was compared with the GenBank reference (accession number: BC050559) and substitutions were confirmed by reverse sequencing. RESULTS",1
"Muscle biopsy revealed no histochemical or biochemical abnormalities and both Southern blot and long-range PCR were normal. Sequencing of POLG1 demonstrated four heterozygous substitutions, A467T, E1143G, Q879H and T885S (fig 2). Sequencing of parental DNA confirmed that the patient had inherited the A467T substitution in cis with T885S and in trans with Q879H and E1143G (fig 2). DISCUSSION",1
"Sodium valproate is a successful and frequently used first line therapy for a variety of different epileptic seizures and syndromes. Its use in very young patients with neurodevelopmental delay and epilepsia partialis continua has been questioned on the grounds that it may precipitate a neurometabolic decompensation in those with Alpers-Huttenlocher disease, leading to irreversible liver failure.6",0
"Orthotopic liver transplantation has been attempted in patients with valproate-induced liver failure, some of whom have later been shown to have Alpers-Huttenlocher disease.9 10 Although successful engraftment was achieved in most patients, they invariably died a short time later following progressive neurological deterioration. Consequently, valproate-induced liver failure has been considered a contraindication to orthotopic liver transplantation, and this was the case for our patient.",0
"Fortunately, his liver failure slowly reversed and 2 years on his epilepsy has been successfully managed without neurological decline. He has an unusual genotype with four different substitutions and this may have influenced the clinical course of his disease. The A467T mutation is known to lower DNA binding affinity and catalytic efficiency of POLG1,11 but the role of the other substitutions is less clear. However, the E1143G mutation has been shown to partially rescue the deleterious effects of the W748S mutation (also associated with AlpersHuttenlocher disease as well as ataxia and peripheral neuropathy), suggesting it may have a disease-modifying role.12 The Q879H and T885S substitutions have not been reported in controls, but in the presence of two confirmed mutations it is difficult to be certain of their precise role in the disease pathogenesis. Both occur within the polymerase domain of POLG1, a region of the gene specifically affected in AlpersHuttenlocher disease (http://tools.niehs.nih.gov/polg/index. cfm). Although neither amino acid substitution appears to be severe (amino acid remains hydrophilic), the Q879H substitution does affect a phylogentically conserved site (amino acid position 885 appears to be less well conserved) and is therefore likely to be contributing to disease.",1
"This case illustrates a clinically important variation in the phenotype of Alpers-Huttenlocher disease, where liver failure has previously been considered a pre-terminal event and invariably associated with an inexorable neurological decline.13 Sodium valproate played a key role in precipitating the liver failure in this case, but the mechanism for this drug effect remains elusive. Based on our observations, we recommend sequencing of POLG1 in children with valproate-induced hepatic failure, particularly as identification of the E1143G",0
"Table 1 Serial liver function tests of this patient over a 6-month period following presentation with encephalopathy Figure 2 A schematic representation of POLG1 showing the functional domains of this gene and the sites of mutation in our patient.

"mutation may indicate a more favourable outcome. Furthermore, we advise that, particularly in young children (,3 years old) with aggressive focal epilepsy, the POLG1 gene should be sequenced prior to commencing sodium valproate therapy. In situations where this is not possible, then serum lactate, ammonia and liver function should be closely monitored.",0

2. Case description,0
The patient is a 54 year-old (yo) man from Central Italy.,1
"His father died at 71 years of lung cancer, had non-insulin",0
dependent diabetes mellitus but was free from any neuro-,0
"logical symptom. The 82 yo mother, a 47 yo brother and",0
two 29 and 24 yo daughters are all alive and well. The pro-,0
positus was born at term after an uneventful pregnancy. In,0
"contrast to what was reported previously [6], this patient",0
"developed PEO with bilateral ptosis at 30 years of age, fol-",1
"lowed by progressive dysphonia with rhinolalia, dysphagia,",1
"proximal muscle weakness and wasting, and tendon are-",1
"flexia. Reduction of caloric intake, caused by severe dys-",1
"phagia and the onset of chronic diarrhoea, resulted in",1
severe body weight loss. At 50 years of age the patient,1
developed tremor in the standing position (dominant fre-,1
"quency at 6.2 Hz) initially affecting the left lower limb, then",0
"both lower limbs, with occasional mild resting tremor of",1
the hands. This patient was included in a recent report,0
on 4 cases affected by levodopa-responsive pseudo-ortho-,0
static tremor in parkinsonism (case 3 in [6]). In the follow-,0
ing 2 years he developed extra-pyramidal rigidity with a,1
"cogwheel sign, reduced tapping (left > right) and postural",1
instability (Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale-,0
UPDRS motor score 21 points). Physical examination,0
"showed a hypomimic face, hypophonia, bilateral ptosis,",1
"ophthalmoplegia, mild symmetrical proximal muscle weak-",1
ness (Medical Research Council grade 4+) and absence of,0
lower limb tendon reflexes. An ECG and structural brain,1
MRI were both normal. A Single-Photon Emission Com-,0
puted Tomography (SPECT) using ([(123)I]-2b-carbome-,0
thoxy-3b-(-4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl)-nortropane,0
(I-FP-CIT SPECT) revealed a bilaterally reduced dopa-,0
mine uptake in the corpus striatum (right > left). Serum,0
creatine kinase (CK) level was 2156 U/L (normal < 140,1
U/L). An EMG was compatible with axonal sensory neu-,1
ropathy associated with myopathic features. The patient,1
was initially treated with low doses of dopamine agonists,0
(pramipexole 2.1 mg/day) associated with levodopa up to,0
400 mg/day with disappearance of standing legs tremor,0
and reduction in UPDRS motor score.,0
Two years later he complained of end-of-dose deteriora-,0
"tion, with re-occurrence of the disabling standing tremor,",1
which appeared 1.5–2.5 h after each single levodopa,0
(UPDRS motor score was 27 in ‘‘on” state and 42 in ‘‘off”,0
state) and was associated with severe anxiety and panic,1
attacks during the ‘‘off” states. Levodopa was increased,0
to 600 mg/day and entacapone was added (1200 mg/day).,0
The patient did not report further fluctuations for the next,0
"6 months, when he developed peak-dose dyskinesias, re-",0
occurrence of end-of-dose deterioration and severe stand-,0
ing tremor. Entacapone was substituted with tolcapone,0
100 mg t.i.d. with reduction of dyskinesias and ‘‘off” state.,0
"Since then, dysphagia has progressively worsened, with fur-",1
"ther loss of weight because of malnutrition, requiring the",1
positioning of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy for,0
enteral nutrition. Onset of ventilatory failure has required,1
mechanical ventilation. The serum CK level remains high,1
"(6143 U/L), with worsening and spreading of the muscle",0
"weakness. High serum CK is an unusual, but occasionally",1
"reported, finding in POLG1-associated PEO with multiple",1
"mtDNA deletions: for instance, Hudson et al. [5] report a",0
patient (individual II:8) with serum CK levels > 2500 U/l.,0
The tremor and the ‘‘off” state now occur 1.5–2 h after,0
"levodopa administration, which must be repeated 7–8 times",0
per day. In the last months the patient has also developed,0
progressive cognitive dysfunction associated with psychotic,1
features.,0
3. Methods,0
Southern blot analysis of mtDNA was carried out on,0
DNA extracted from skeletal muscle following standard,0
procedures [7] and using the ECL chemiluminescence as,0
the detection method. DNA from peripheral blood lym-,0
phocytes was used as a template to amplify the 22 coding,0
exons of the POLG1 gene (exons 223). Polymerase chain,1
"reaction (PCR) conditions were 96 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for",0
"20 s and 72 °C for 60 s, for 30 cycles plus as initial denatur-",0
ation step at 96 °C for 2 min. PCR fragments were ana-,0
lyzed by automated nucleotide sequencing using the Big-,0
Dye terminator Ready Reaction Kit version 2 on a 3100,0
Genetic Analyzer Automated Sequencer (Applied Biosys-,0
tems). The sequence variants found in the patient were,0
searched for in available relatives as well as in 100 consec-,0
utive control subjects (200 alleles).,0
4. Results,0
A skeletal muscle biopsy taken when the patient was 32,0
years old showed the presence of several ragged-red fibers,1
"with variation of fiber caliber and nuclear centralization,",1
and reduced or absent reactivity to cytochrome c oxidase,1
(Fig. 1A). Sequence analysis of mtDNA excluded the pres-,0
ence of point mutations commonly associated with,0
"MERRF and MELAS. However, Southern blot analysis",0
revealed the presence of a collection of deleted mtDNA,0
species in addition to wild-type mtDNA (Fig. 1B) [6].,0
These results prompted us to consider the possibility,0
of mutation(s) in one of the nucleus-encoded genes com-,0
"monly associated with mtDNA instability and PEO,",1
"namely Twinkle, ANT1 and POLG1. Sequence analysis",0
of the first two genes ruled out the presence of patho-,0
"genic mutations. However, sequence analysis of the entire",0
coding region of the POLG1 gene led us to the identifi-,1
cation of two novel heterozygous mutations. One is a,0
"c.1288A > T transversion, predicting a p.M430L amino-",1
"acid substitution. The second is a c.2752T > C transition,",1
determining the aminoacid substitution p.W918R,1
"(Fig. 2A). Segregation analysis, carried out in available",0
"members of the family (Fig. 2B), revealed the presence",0
of the 2752T > C heterozygous mutation in the mother,1
"of the patient and in the two healthy daughters, while",0
no mutation was detected in his brother.,0

5. Discussion,0
We found two novel heterozygous POLG1 mutations in,0
"a compound heterozygous patient characterized by PEO,",1
muscle weakness and later onset levodopa-responsive,1
pseudo-orthostatic tremor and parkinsonism [6].,1
The maternal allele predicts a p.W918R aminoacid sub-,1
stitution in a highly conserved position in the pol cA poly-,0
merase domain (http://dir-apps.niehs.nih.gov/polg/) [8].,0
The paternal allele harbors a c.1288A > T transversion pre-,1
dicting the replacement of the p.M430 residue into an L,1
residue. M430 is contained within the so-called spacer,0
"Fig. 1. Morphological and molecular findings in skeletal muscle. (A) Top panel, NADH dehydrogenase staining shows RRF (asterisks); bottom panel,",0
"cytochrome c oxidase staining of a serial muscle section shows several fibers with reduced or absent reactivity, including the same two RRF shown in the",1
top panel (asterisks). (B) Southern blot analysis on PvuII-linearized mtDNA performed on the muscle biopsy of the patient (P) and a control (C). Both P,0
"and C samples show a 16.6 kb band corresponding to wild-type mtDNA (arrow). In addition, the P sample shows a collection of smaller bands",0
corresponding to deletion-containing mtDNA species.,0

"domain, a region encompassing the midportion of pol cA,",0
which in multicellular eukaryotes interacts with two pol cB,0
accessory subunits to form a functionally active trimeric,0
"holoenzyme. Pol cB orthologs are absent in fungi, which",0
can explain why M430 is conserved in metazoan pol cA,0
"sequences but not in fungal orthologs (for instance,",0
MIP1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (Fig. 2C). Segregation,0
analysis in the family and absence of either mutation in,0
200 control alleles further support the pathogenic role of,0
the mutations.,0
The role of POLG1 genetic variants in the pathogenesis,0
of parkinsonism is suggested by several reports. Parkinson-,0
ism was documented in 13 affected members of five out of,0
seven POLG1 mutant PEO families reported by Luoma,0
et al. [3]. Three of these families displayed dominant trans-,0
mission of the trait and were found to carry a heterozygous,0
"c.2864A > G (p.Y955C) mutation, one of the most com-",0
mon pathogenic variants of POLG1 [9]. In two additional,0
families both parkinsonism and PEO were transmitted as,0
"an allegedly recessive trait. However, while the three",0
affected members of the first of these families carried two,0
"allelic POLG1 mutations, namely c.1402A > G",0
"(p.N468D) and c.3313G > A (p.A1105T), only the latter",0
was found in heterozygosity in the single patient of the sec-,0
ond family. Good response to levodopa was documented in,0
all patients to whom this treatment had been given.,0
Five additional POLG1 mutant patients belonging to,0
three families were described with a combination of PEO,0
"and parkinsonism, but in some of these cases the patho-",0
genic role of the mutations remains controversial. This is,0
the case for a family including a 49 yo woman with autoso-,0
"mal dominant PEO, neuropathy, hypogonadism and par-",0
kinsonism and her 59 yo brother with overt parkinsonian,0
features [4]. Multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions in,0
muscle and a heterozygous POLG1 missense mutation,0
"c.2492A > G, leading to p.Y831C aminoacid replacement,",0
were found in the proband and her affected brother. The,0
"patient was successfully treated with levodopa. However,",0
the c.2492A > G transition has been reported in about,0
2% of control subjects in Poland and in normal controls,0
"in Finns [10,11] and Italians (MZ and FI, personal obser-",0
vation). These observations suggest that the p.Y831C ami-,0
noacid substitution is a non-pathogenic variant in different,0
European populations.,0
"A second family included several PEO patients, one also",0
being affected by parkinsonism. In this family autosomal,0
dominant PEO segregated with a c.1532G > A heterozy-,0
"gous missense mutation (p.S511N) in exon 8, in combina-",0
tion with an intronic variant c.2070 + c.158G > A in cis,0
[5]. The subject also affected by parkinsonism was found,0
to carry an allelic in-trans change c.1389G > T (p.L463F),0
"the pathogenic role of which is as yet not determined,",0
although the latter was the only change detected in an,0
unaffected sibling.,0
A third family was composed of two sisters with early-,0
onset parkinsonism and signs of sensorimotor axonal,0
"peripheral neuropathy, without PEO; both were compound",0
"heterozygous, carrying the already reported c.2557C > T",0
"(p.R853W) in exon 16 [12] of one allele, while the other",0
"allele carried a second, novel mutation c.2209C > A",0
(p.G737R) in exon 13. One sister was treated with levodopa,0
at low dosage but she developed early oromandibular,0
"dyskinesias, the other was treated with dopamine agonists.",0
"Besides the POLG1 mutant patients mentioned above, a",0
heterozygous mutation c.1121G > A (p.R374Q) was,0
reported in exon 1 of the Twinkle in a single family com-,0
"posed of 10 PEO patients, three of whom had also parkin-",0
"sonism [13]. Finally, a PEO patient with a levodopa-",0
"responsive parkinsonism, dyskinesias and motor fluctua-",0
tions [14] was shown to harbor mtDNA deletions in muscle,0
but no mutation was found in either of the known PEO-,0
associated genes.,0
A comparative study of 420 Parkinson’s disease patients,0
and controls did not support the role for common POLG1,0
"genetic variants in parkinsonism, concluding that domi-",0
nant POLG1 mutations are a rare cause of parkinsonism,0
[15]. The hypothesis that length variants of the pol cA,0
polyglutamine tract may predispose to idiopathic sporadic,0
Parkinson’s disease was suggested by studies on Finns,0
"[3,11], but has not as yet been confirmed in other popula-",0
"tions. On the other hand, POLG1 mutations are not the",0
only cause of mtDNA defects associated with parkinson-,0
ism [16].,0
"Interestingly, high levels of deleted mtDNAs were",0
recently reported in neurons of the Substantia Nigra pars,0
compacta in aged individuals. Patients with Parkinson’s,0
disease showed levels of deleted mtDNA that were signifi-,0
cantly higher than in age-matched control brains [17].,0
These recent results support the long-lasting hypothesis,0
that mitochondrial dysfunctions play a role in the patho-,0
"genesis of Parkinson’s disease, as well as other adult-onset",0
"neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease,",0
Huntington’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,0
"[18]. Interestingly, in two patients [12], including ours,",0
dyskinesias heralded the parkinsonism associated with,0
POLG1 mutations. The latter can be concealed by the pres-,0
ence of peripheral neuropathy and muscle weakness.,0
The identification of two novel POLG1 mutations,0
expressing a phenotype characterized by PEO and parkin-,0
sonism supports the hypothesis that loss of mtDNA integ-,0
rity is implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s,0
disease. Combination of myopathic and neuromuscular,0
symptoms with parkinsonism should prompt to include,0
the screening of the POLG1 gene in the diagnostic work-,0
"out, especially, but not exclusively, when the syndrome is",0
inherited.,0

"Abstract: Patients harboring A467T and W748S POLG1 mutations present with a broad variety of neurological phenotypes, including cerebellar ataxia, progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), myoclonus, epilepsy, and peripheral neuropathy. With exception of ataxia and myoclonus, movement disorders are not typical features of POLG1 associated disorders. We report on two affected siblings compound heterozygous for A467T and W748S mutations, one suffering from choreoathetosis and apraxia of lid opening due to focal eyelid dystonia that mimicked progression of ptosis, resulting in functional blindness. So far, focal dystonia has not been reported in POLG1 mutation carriers, and should be considered when investigating patients with PEO and ptosis. Further studies on POLG1 mutations in focal dystonia are warranted. © 2008 Movement Disorder Society",0

"nant and recessive neurological phenotypes, including progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), ptosis, cerebellar ataxia, epilepsy, dementia, myopathy, myoclonus, peripheral neuropathy, and headache, in some cases accompanied by liver involvement.1 In POLG1 associated disorders, relationship between genotype and phenotype is complex, with a considerable overlap of clinical spectrum.2,3 With exception of ataxia and myoclonus, movement disorders are not typical features of POLG1 mutations. Recently, Parkinsonism has been associated to POLG1, accompanied either by PEO and other characteristic symptoms,4 or neuropathy alone.5 One study in Finnish patients with recessive ataxia due to homozygous W748S mutations described involuntary movements, namely athetoid and choreoathetoid movements of extremities and face, and tremor of head and limbs.6",0
"Here, we report on two siblings compound heterozygous for A467T and W748S, the most frequent recessive POLG1 mutations, presenting with a remarkably later onset and longer survival than most patients of the same genotype. One suffered from choreoathetosis and apraxia of lid opening (ALO) due to dystonic activity of eyelid muscles, resulting in functional blindness. So far, dystonia has not been reported in POLG1 mutation carriers.",1

"Three sisters, ages 39 (Patient 1), 38, and 37 (Patient 2), the children of nonconsanguineous parents, were normal at birth and through childhood. The oldest developed neurological symptoms at the age of 28, heralded by episodic headache, cognitive decline, and seizures, repeatedly resulting in generalized status epilepticus. When seen ﬁrst at age 32, Patient 1 presented with marked ataxia, both due to cerebellar affection and sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy, dysarthria, PEO with diplopia, mild bilateral ptosis, epilepsy, moderate cognitive impairment, myoclonus and choreoathetoid movements of the arms and perioral muscles. She had never been treated with neuroleptics. MRI of the brain showed moderate generalized cerebral atrophy, including midbrain and cerebellum.

RESULTS,0
Clinical Course,0
"After initial presentation, Patient 1 was seen at regular intervals, and a slow worsening of diplopia, neuropathy, and ataxia was documented, whereas epilepsy,",1
"choreoathetosis, and cognitive function remained stable. Involuntary closing of the eyes due to lowering of the lids also worsened, at ﬁrst attributed to aggravation of ptosis, resulting in phases of functional blindness at the age of 35. At this time, she started to recline her head and to hold open her eyes with her ﬁngers during conversation or reading attempts, accompanied by voluntary contraction of the frontalis muscle, as sometimes observed in ALO. Although no apparent blepharospasm was observed, and the patient’s maneuvers did not function as a sensory trick, we assumed dystonic closing of the eyelids (in contrast to myopathic ptosis), and needle electromyography revealed persistent and dystonic muscle activity of the pretarsal part of the orbicularis oculi muscle. Injections of botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A; Botox1) into both upper eyelids (4 units per side) led to marked improvement with mild residual ptosis only, similar to the initial clinical examination. BoNT/A injections were continued in",1

"Long-range PCR detected multiple mtDNA deletions in skeletal muscle of Patients 1 and 2. Both were compound heterozygous for A467T and W748S POLG1 mutations. Mother and healthy sister were heterozygous for the W748S mutation, and the father was heterozygous for the A467T mutation. As described before,3,6 W748S was found together with E1143G in each case, suggesting allelic coupling of both mutations.",1

"more obvious in Patient 1 with earlier disease onset and more severe clinical phenotype (reduction of 68% and 56%, respectively). Also, mean copy numbers of the healthy family members were lower when compared with mean values of controls, reaching signiﬁcance in the mother only.",0
DISCUSSION,0
"Our study on a family of A467T and W748S POLG1 mutation carriers, including two affected siblings, extends previous observations on the diversity of clinical spectrum in POLG1 associated disorders. In Patient 1, diagnosis of ALO due to focal eyelid dystonia was probably delayed, because it accompanied mild ptosis in PEO and mimicked severe paresis of eyelid muscles. Indeed, ALO is known to occur without any obvious spasms of the orbicularis oculi muscle as seen in typical blepharospasm, frequently hampering recognition.8 Difﬁculties in separating blepharospasm and ALO from myasthenic or myopathic ptosis were reported before, and in some cases, the underlying disorder was only unmasked by a poor response with severe ptosis after BoNT/A treatment.9,10 In isolated ALO, BoNT/A was shown to be effective,11 and our patient suffered no side effects after repeated injections. In ambiguous cases, distinct electromyographic features of the various compounds of the orbicularis oculi muscle in blepharospasm and ALO offer clariﬁcation.12",1
"Frequently, ALO with and without blepharospasm is associated to neurodegenerative disorders, mostly Parkinson’s disease and progressive supranuclear palsy.8 Focal dystonia was reported in Leigh’s syndrome and Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy,13 but is not a typical feature of mitochondrial disease in adulthood. So far, it was unknown in patients harboring POLG1 mutations. As a defect of mitochondrial complex I was implicated in the pathogenesis of focal dystonia before,14 and mitochondrial disease presenting with dystonia as dominant clinical phenotype was reported very recently,15 our observation justiﬁes further examination of POLG1 mutations in focal dystonia. In fact, it was shown that POLG1 mutations can lead to basal ganglia dysfunction, namely parkinsonism, even in the absence of primary clinical features of POLG1 associated disorders.5",0
"Finally, our observations might further elucidate the complex relationship between genotype and phenotype in POLG1, and diagnostic procedures. First, our patients had a later disease onset and longer survival time than most A467T and W748S compound heterozygotes reported before, and those of similar course of disease featured a phenotype resembling our affected",1
"siblings.2,3 We hypothesize that, although often severe, a subgroup of compound heterozygotes shows a considerable milder phenotype of later disease onset and longer survival, eventually distinguished by ataxia and adult-onset PEO, probably deﬁned by further, yet unknown, genomic variations. Second, mtDNA content in blood was signiﬁcantly reduced in both patients compared to ageand sex-matched healthy controls, suggesting that mtDNA depletion is not restricted to liver or muscle tissue in POLG 1 associated disorders, but may be detected in easily obtainable blood samples as well.",0
"In conclusion, POLG1 mutations might present with treatable focal dystonia, which should be considered in cases of PEO and ptosis. Further studies on POLG1 mutations in focal dystonia are warranted.",1

"Abstract: Huntington’s disease (HD) produces debilitating motor abnormalities that are poorly responsive to medical therapy. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the posteroventral globus pallidus internus (GPi) may offer a treatment option for patients with diskinetic phenotype and minimal cognitive impairment, but its role in the management of HD remains unclear and to date only two cases have been reported. We report the outcome of GPi-DBS in a 72year-old man with HD. Stimulation at 130 Hz caused a rapid amelioration of chorea producing the worsening of bradykinesia, whereas 40 Hz stimulation (maintaining constant the total electrical energy delivered) improved chorea while preserving the ability to walk. At 1-year follow-up, chorea has completely disappeared; however, the patient was unable to stand and walk. The cognitive proﬁle showed a progressive deterioration, with an extension of deﬁcit from the mainly dysexecutive alterations at baseline to a more diffused cognitive deterioration. © 2008 Movement Disorder Society",0

"tion,3 and deep brain stimulation (DBS).4,5 The preferred target of DBS is the posteroventral globus pallidus internus (GPi) because of the striking effects of pallidal surgery for choreodystonic movements induced by levodopa (L-dopa) in Parkinson’s disease (PD),6 senile chorea,7 and chorea associated with cerebral palsy.8 To date, two HD cases treated with GPi-DBS have been reported.4,5 Further experience is needed to conﬁrm the efﬁcacy of DBS in HD, to guide the development of patient selection criteria, and to determine the optimal target sites and stimulation parameters. In this report, we describe the use of bilateral GPi-DBS in a",0
HD patient with medically intractable chorea.,0
METHODS,0
"DBS leads (model 3387; Medtronic) were bilaterally implanted under general anesthesia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography were utilized for targeting procedures. The leads were connected to an implantable pulse generator (IPG) (Kinetra, Medtronic), which was secured in the subcutaneous tissues of the chest.",0
"The effect of the stimulation by means of each of the four electrode contacts was investigated using different settings of stimulation (frequency: 40, 130, and 180 Hz; pulse width: 60, 90, 120, 180, and 210 mcsec; voltage: from 1 to 7 V). The patient was evaluated 15 min after the change of parameters, and after 24 hours when a new set of parameters was tested.",0

"The patient is a 72-year-old man with genetically conﬁrmed HD. His motor symptoms began at age 55 and progressed to severe generalized choreathetosis. Within the previous 2 years, he showed weight loss and balance impairment with falls. The introduction of haloperidol induced a marked sedation, whereas tetrabenazine was tolerated only at low doses with only modest beneﬁt (Table 1). Because of the absence of severe psychiatric disorders and neuropsychological deﬁcits (Table 2), the patient was considered eligible for bilateral GPi-DBS. Surgical procedure was well tolerated.",0
Effect on Motor Function,0
"The patient was discharged from the hospital with IPG left off to allow stabilization of the micropallidotomy effect, which caused only a mild reduction of dyskinesias (Table 1). One month after surgery, monopolar stimulation using ventral contacts seemed to be more efﬁcacious on chorea but it was associated with a severe hypotonia of axial muscles causing ﬂexion of the head and loss of trunk control. Parameters was maintained as follows: right GPi: 2.6 V, 130 Hz, 90 mcsec, contact 2 negative and case positive; left GPi:",0
"2.7 V, 130 Hz, 90 mcsec, contact 6 negative and case positive.",0
"Four months after the surgery, we found that stimulation at 40 Hz signiﬁcantly improved chorea. Five minutes after the IPG was switched on, limbs chorea improved consistently while mild dyskinesias were still present on the face and shoulders. Chorea gradually reappeared 15 min after the IPG has been switched off. Stimulation at 130 Hz caused further improvement of chorea but also worsening of bradykinesia and a severe disturbance of gait characterized by freezing and start hesitation; the effect of these different frequencies was conﬁrmed in double-blind fashion maintaining constant TEED calculated by means of both the proposed methods (Table 1). Accordingly, stimulation parameters were changed as follows: right GPi: 2.0 V, 40 Hz, 90 mcsec, contact 1 negative and case positive; left GP:",0
"2.0 V, 40 Hz, 90 mcsec, contact 5 negative and case positive.",0
"During the following months, gait and apathy progressively worsened. Despite the complete resolution of chorea and an associated weight gain, which allowed the withdrawal of the medications, the patient’s level of independence worsened due to the severe impairment of autonomous gait. The lowering of amplitude of stimulation did not improve the axial impairment. Eleven months after surgery, the stimulation was switched off and, surprisingly, this did not cause the reoccurrence of chorea (Table 1). A 250-mg L-dopa challenge improved the patient’s ability to arise",0

Effect on Cognitive Functions (Table 2),0
"At baseline evaluation (1 month before surgery), the patient’s cognitive proﬁle was characterized mainly by dysexecutive syndrome. On the ﬁrst follow-up visit, 6 months after surgery, the score of Mini-Mental State Examination worsened as did scores of test for executive functions. Scores of linguistic and memory task",0
"were lower as well. On the second follow-up visit, 1 year after surgery, he performed worse on all executive tasks, in comparison with both the baseline and 1st follow-up visits. Scores worsened also on phonological ﬂuency task and on elementary constructional abilities.",0
"We have conﬁrmed that bilateral GPi-DBS produces a long-term reduction of chorea due to HD. Despite the beneﬁt, surgery has been related to worsening of gait, apathy, and decline of cognitive function.",0
1292	A. FASANO ET AL.,0
"In the past, pallidotomy has been associated with only modest palliative functional improvement in dystonic features1 or worsening of parkinsonism.2,4 Based on this, it has been suggested that the use of DBS to maximize beneﬁts and minimize potential side effects such as bradykinesia. In the ﬁrst 8-month-follow up report on the use of GPi-DBS to treat HD chorea, authors reported a dramatic reduction of dyskinesias: stimulations at 40 and 130 Hz (maintaining constant the TEED) were equally effective but the second worsened bradykinesia.4 According to Koss et al., the equation utilized to calculate the TEED was incorrect and it was not possible to discern whether the observed clinical effects resulted from changes in stimulation frequency or from the overall increase in TEED.10 We conﬁrmed the ﬁndings of Moro et al. by maintaining constant TEED calculated with both the equations proposed. This would suggest that in HD the clinical effect of DBS is frequency-dependent and support the concept that bradykinesia and chorea probably reﬂect underlying differences in neuronal ﬁring patterns and coding.14 However, it is difﬁcult to say to what extend TEED reﬂects the real impact of the stimulation on the neurons and axons for at least two reasons: (1) TEED does not reﬂect the size and the shape of the electrical ﬁeld; (2) it is known that voltage is the most critical factor for alteration of cell population activity in the human brain.9",0
"The secondly reported HD patient had a 12 months lasting, reversible suppression of his choreathetoid movements after surgery. A trial of reduced frequency to 40 Hz produced a poor control of chorea and required reinstitution of high-frequency stimulation (180 Hz). At 10 months, the patient’s glottic function worsened, and concerns of dysphagia and airway protection prompted institutionalization; by 12 months his rigidity also progressed. These side effects were not improved by lowered IPG voltage or by turning the stimulator off.5 Similar to our case, a delayed worsening of parkinsonism was present and it did not change even after a prolonged period without stimulation.",0
"The pathophysiology of the evolving and delayed worsening of gait and akinesia is difﬁcult to explain. In this single case it is not possible to exclude that it was at least in part related to the evolution of the disease and that also the long-term improvement of chorea was related to its progression toward a parkinsonian phenotype. However, DBS may have actually produced a pallidotomic effect, analogous to the worsening of bradykinesia observed after pallidotomy in HD patients.2,4 The effect of isolated lesions of GPi in subjects not affected by PD or dystonia has been",0
recently reviewed as follows: the clinical picture is characterized mainly by axial parkinsonism and delayed onset of symptoms after the initial insult.15 Our patient shares some of these features.,0
"This is the ﬁrst study systematically assessing the cognitive proﬁle of an HD patient treated with DBS: evaluations showed a progressive deterioration, with an extension of deﬁcit from the mainly dysexecutive alterations at baseline to a more diffused cognitive deterioration. The cause of such worsening is only speculative since it is not possible to discern whether it has been caused by the effect of surgery or by the natural course of the disease. In addition, it is not possible to estimate the real impact of stimulation on cognitive functions since the patient was always assessed in stimulation-on condition.",0
"The outcome of the patient hence reported highlights the important ethical decisions that must be made in treating patients with HD. DBS may aid the symptoms, but will not stem the inexorable deterioration of patients with this disease. In addition, similarly to another case,5 the functional gain of our patient was negligible. Whether or not DBS should be used on a regular basis in such patients still remains to be determined. Further experience with this population will guide the development of patient selection criteria, deﬁne the optimal sites and stimulation parameters for DBS, and elucidate the electrophysiological changes in HD.",0

This type of dyskinesias may appear in patients even in the prolonged absence of antiparkinson medication and be aggravated by levodopa. Therefore, pharmacological therapeutic approaches in these patients are limited. Here we report two patients with bilateral fetal nigral grafts in the caudate and putamen subjected to deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) or subthalamic nucleus (STN). Clinical assessment was performed according to UPDRS and the clinical dyskinesia rating scale. In both patients, we found signiﬁcant improvement in OFF-period symptoms as well as levodopa-induced dyskinesias. However, only GPi-DBS led to a signiﬁcant reduction of OFF-period dyskinesias whereas STN-DBS did not inﬂuence dyskinesias unrelated to external dopaminergic application. These ﬁndings, based on two case reports, highlight the pivotal role of the GPi in mediating dyskinesia-related neural activity within the basal ganglia loop. © 2008 Movement Disorder Society",0

Dopaminergic medication was completely withdrawn. The adjustment of stimulation parameters, however, was difﬁcult due to a very low threshold for stimulationinduced dyskinesias that resembled the previous Ldopa-induced peak-dose dyskinesias.

"Following transplantation, he experienced considerable reduction of OFF-phase symptoms in the medication OFF condition, which was stable for 8 years (Table 1). One year following transplantation, however, disabling OFF-period dyskinesias gradually occurred with continuous choreoathetoid movements in arms and ﬁngers (CDRS 6/28, Videotape). Additionally, he was suffering from severe L-dopa-induced dyskinesias (CDRS 10/28). Despite reduction of LEDD to 100 mg and antidyskinetic therapy with amantadine he continued to have dyskinesias throughout the day (UPDRS IV item 32: 4/4), which were rated as severely disabling (UPDRS IV item 33: 3/4) (Table 1).",0
"Because of the prominent hyperkinesias but relatively few OFF-period symptoms, 8 years after bilateral grafting, the patient was selected for bilateral GPi-DBS. GPi-DBS signiﬁcantly reduced dyskinesias (CDRS 2/28 in the formal assessment, Videotape). In contrast, the patient reported complete reduction of dyskinesias during the day (item 32 und 33 0/4). Because OFF-period symptoms were concomitantly improved (UPDRS III 11/108 in the formal assessment), all dopaminergic medication could be stopped.",0
"These two case reports demonstrate that diseaseand treatment-related complications following fetal nigral grafting in PD can be effectively treated by DBS. In patient 1, STN-DBS primarily improved OFF-period symptoms, which reduced the necessity for additional dopaminergic drug therapy. The effect on dyskinesias, however, was not immediate. In fact, this patient became very sensitive to stimulation-induced dyskinesias and continued to exhibit ﬂuctuating choreoathetoid dyskinesias with stable stimulation parameters even after complete withdrawal of any dopaminergic drugtherapy. These ‘‘OFF-period’’ dyskinesias resembled clinically the peak-dose dyskinesias before surgery and were probably the result of an interaction between STNDBS and diurnal ﬂuctuations in the release of dopamine",0
"from the fetal graft. The failure to reduce OFF-period dyskinesias in our patient contrasts with a previous report5 that found marked reduction of off-period dyskinesias by STN-DBS. However, in this abstract, the stereotactic position of the stimulation contacts has not been speciﬁed and therefore the beneﬁcial effect may not be attributed to stimulation of the STN proper but rather the adjacent subthalamic area. Following this notion, a previous study reported signiﬁcant reduction of L-dopa-induced dyskinesias through STN-DBS, most probably due to stimulation of the subthalamic area.6 A recent computational model afﬁrmed the clinical ﬁnding that stimulation contacts positioned in the dorsal portion of the STN simultaneously inﬂuence GPi ﬁbers of passage within the subthalamic area and therefore potentially reduce dyskinesias.7",0
"In patient 2, GPi-DBS signiﬁcantly improved both OFF-period dyskinesias and L-dopa-induced dyskinesias and reduced the severity of OFF-motor signs. The beneﬁcial effect of GPi-DBS on OFF-period dyskinesias in our patient parallels the outcome of a previously reported single case observation.8",0
"The etiology of OFF-period dyskinesias following striatal fetal nigral grafting is still unclear. The development of dyskinesias after transplantation is probably not associated with dopaminergic overgrowth or excessive dopamine release from the grafts. Accordingly, [18F] PET studies in PD patients with postgrafting dyskinesias have not provided evidence for dopaminergic overgrowth.4 Favored hypotheses rather involve patchy and uneven dopaminergic innervation resulting in dopamine overﬂow from reinnervated into nonreinnervated striatal regions and activation of supersensitive dopamine receptors. Inﬂammatory reactions around the grafts may further promote dyskinesias. Eventually, unfavorable composition of the graft with respect to the predominant type of dopaminergic neurones from the substantia nigra or ventral tegmental area may play a role.9",0
"The pathophysiological sequelae of unregulated intrastriatal dopamine release following fetal nigral grafting on the direct and indirect basal ganglia pathway have not been speciﬁcally investigated. However, experimental studies on L-dopa-induced dyskinesias have highlighted the crucial role of D1 dopamine receptor-mediated transmission at the level of the direct pathway from the striatum to the GPi.10 Increased sensitivity of D1 dopamine receptors have recently been identiﬁed as a prominent risk factor for dyskinesias.11 Consequently, in animal and human studies, alterations of the direct pathway due to L-dopa-induced dyskinesias led to fundamental changes in the electrophysio-",0
1296	J. HERZOG ET AL.,0
"logical properties of the GPi with reduced GPi ﬁring rates and abnormal bursting discharge.12 Modulation of the pathological activity within the GPi by means of DBS immediately reduces dyskinesias irrespective of the medication state.13 In contrast, intervening within the STN probably does not directly ameliorate L-dopainduced dyskinesias but rather exerts its antidyskinetic inﬂuence by postoperative reduction of dopaminergic medication.13 The superior effect of GPi-DBS compared to STN-DBS in reducing OFF-period dyskinesias, unrelated to external dopamine application, supports this concept assigning a pivotal role to the direct pathway in mediating dyskinesia-related neural activity. Alternatively or complementary to the proposed systemic effects on neural activity within the basal ganglia loop, differential effects of STN-DBS versus GPi-DBS14 on striatal dopamine release may impact the different outcomes in our patients. However, in contrast to the results of aforementioned animal studies, a PET study in PD patients with STN-DBS failed to detect any signiﬁcant change in the extracellular striatal concentration of dopamine.15",0
"In conclusion, we showed that following fetal nigral grafting patients can beneﬁt from additional neuromodulation therapy. The choice of target may need to be tailored to the individual clinical symptomatology. STNDBS in our patient led to marked improvement in hypokinetic ﬂuctuations but was less effective in reducing OFF-period dyskinesias. In patients with prominent OFF-period dyskinesias after fetal nigral transplantation, GPi-DBS may be the better option because of its immediate antidyskinetic effect. However, the small number of patients enrolled and some shortcoming in trying all possible stimulation parameters (patient 1) may limit the conclusions that can be drawn from our data.",0

We report an LND patient with low dopamine metabolite values in cerebrospinal ﬂuid for whom early levodopa/carbidopa therapy was begun with a notable clinical improvement.

"chemically characterized by hyperuricemia.1 The clinical features associated with LND include those related directly to the hyperuricemia (gout, nephrolithiasis, arthritis, etc.), neurobehavioral manifestations indicative of central nervous system (CNS) disturbances, and other clinical signs (hyperemesis, anemia, etc.).1 Delayed motor development, dystonia, choreoathetosis, dysarthria, hypotonia, pyramidal signs, and aggressive and/or self-injurious behavior have been described as the most characteristic neurobehavioral manifestations.2 The exact pathophysiological mechanism by which the impaired purine metabolism causes these neurobehavioral disturbances remains unclear, but abnormal central monoamine metabolism may play a role. In particular, several lines of evidence suggest that LND is associated with an abnormal CNS dopaminergic function. However, only a few studies have reported treatment protocols using substitutive levodopa, and they describe very heterogeneous responses to therapy.",0
We report the case of a child affected with LND presenting low dopamine (DA) metabolite values in cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF). Treatment with L-dopa/carbidopa was started during the early stages of his neurodevelopment.,0
CLINICAL REPORT,0
"The patient is a boy, the second child of healthy nonconsanguineous parents. Pregnancy, delivery, and neonatal period were uneventful. From the ﬁrst days of his life, a lack of spontaneous movements and poor head control were present. Clinical examination at 4 months revealed marked hypertonia of the extremities, brisk deep reﬂexes, bilateral Babinski’s sign, and trunkal hypotonia with no abnormal movements. Head circumference and ocular pursuit were appropriate. Brain MRI disclosed slight signs of cortical atrophy. Blood cell count, glucose, transaminases, CK, creatinine, uric acid, ammonia, lactate, pyruvate, plasma amino acids, urine organic acids, and uric acid were normal. Ocular examination, evoked auditive potentials, nerve conduction, and electromyography were also normal. At the age of 10 months, he developed tremor and marked dystonic movements of the hands and the mouth (Video 1). Serum urate was elevated (484 lmol/L [normal range: 100–330 lmol/L)], and in 24 hours urine, the urinary uric acid/creatinine ratio was in the upper normal limit (2.1 mmol/mol creatinine; normal range: 0.2–2 mmol/mol creatinine). HPRT activity was requested. At the same time, due to the presence of dyskinetic movements, a lumbar puncture was performed, showing low levels of homovanillic acid",0

"(HVA) in CSF compared to age normal range3 (Table 1). Treatment with L-dopa/carbidopa (1/0.25 proportion) was gradually introduced (up to 3 mg/kg/day), resulting in moderate improvement. At the age of 1 year and 6 months, the patient showed better head control, and he started picking up objects; dyskinetic movements were still present, while peripheral hypertonia and brisk deep tendon reﬂexes decreased notably (Video 2). The low CSF HVA concentration together with the clinical improvement led us to hypothesize a primary neurotransmitter synthesis defect, but tyrosine hydroxylase gene study showed no mutations. When uric acid metabolism was assessed again, the patient presented a serum urate value of 463 lmol/L (normal range: 100–330 lmol/L), urinary uric acid/creatinine ratio at 2.32 mmol/mol creatinine (normal range: 0.2–2 mmol/mol creatinine), and markedly elevated renal excretion of xanthine and hypoxanthine. HPRT activity in hemolisate was undetectable, and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase activity was elevated (59 nmol/hour/ mg hemoglobin; normal range: 19–38 nmol/hour/mg hemoglobin). Molecular analysis disclosed a 5-bp deletion in HPRT exon 3, corresponding to position 261– 265 of HPRT mRNA, associated with a 12-bp insertion in position 261. This mutation has not been previously reported, and it predicted a change in HPRT protein with a frameshift after Gly58 and a stop codon in position 74. The child has presented a moderate progressive improvement to date (3 years of age). Therapy with L-dopa/carbidopa (up to 6 mg/kg/day) and folinic acid (to avoid cerebral folate deﬁciency) has not been withdrawn. Head control has been fully attained, tremor has completely disappeared, the quality of movements is notably more precise, and the patient sits without support. Dystonic movements are still present although less pronouncedly than baseline con-",0
"We describe the case of a child affected with LND presenting clinical signs of impaired CNS dopaminergic function. The notable tremor, the marked dystonia developed during early infancy, and the obvious sustained response to L-dopa led us to investigate a primary dopaminergic defect. However, some clinical characteristics such as the absence of oculogyric crisis and the preservation of facial gesticulation did not ﬁt into a primary dopaminergic defect picture.",0
"It has been suggested that LND may be associated with abnormal dopaminergic function, including neuropathological, biochemical, and neuroimaging studies. While no morphological abnormalities in the CNS of LND patients have been reported, direct measurement of neurotransmitters in brain tissue has shown that DA and HVA are signiﬁcantly lower in the limbic and striatal regions of deceased LND patients.4,5 Moreover, pathological studies have shown increased dopamine D2-receptor immunoreactivity in putamen, and, less evidently in the caudate nucleus.5 As a result of recent ﬁndings, a theory of postsynaptic DA supersensitivity owing to a decreased presynaptic DA activity, has been formulated.5 Interestingly, when the substantia nigra was explored, DA levels turned out to be not signiﬁcantly lower than in controls,4 and tyrosine hydroxilase neurons and ﬁbers were not decreased.4 These ﬁndings suggest that the DA terminals are reduced and damaged due to a developmental or a degenerative process, ﬁnally resulting in impaired activity in the striatum.",0
"Moreover, evidence of dopaminergic function abnormalities also comes from positron emission tomography images, which show an abnormally reduced number of dopaminergic nerve terminals and cell bodies involving all dopaminergic pathways, but especially in the putamen.6,7",0
"The role of neurotransmitters in brain development has recently been documented.8 Interestingly, the early dopaminergic input from the midbrain may play an important role in the development of the basal ganglia and cerebral cortex.9 Furthermore, brain development has to be completed during the ﬁrst months of life, when axonal and dendritic branching is ongoing and synaptogenesis is just beginning.

these neurodevelopmental periods may be crucial for further CNS function.,0
"CSF dopamine metabolite analysis has previously been examined to assess the functioning of the CNS dopamine pathway in LND10–13 by measuring the end product of DA: HVA. These studies were performed some time ago (during the 70s and the 80s) and sometimes their results were not adequately evaluated.11 Obtained HVA values must be properly compared to age-related control ranges, so as to permit an accurate interpretation of the results (the concentration of brain neurotransmitters is inversely correlated with age).3 The patient described above initially presented slightly decreased levels of CSF HVA compared to age-related controls (Table 1). Silverstein et al. described agerelated changes of HVA in CSF, and their results showed that the deﬁciencies of HVA increased from infancy to adolescence.13 Perhaps our patient’s young age obscured DA deﬁciency. Nonetheless, biochemical response to L-dopa treatment was remarkable, and second sample HVA values were higher, and inside the normal range. However, the notably clinical improvement described could have been developmental and/or due to L-dopa therapy. Their respective contributions are difﬁcult to evaluate, owing to the heterogeneity of LND.",0
"Among the previously reported L-dopa treated patients, some failed to improve, while some even presented intolerable side effects.10–13 An important limitation in the evaluation of the therapies used in the preceding reports was the different ages at which treatment was started. It is likely that delayed L-dopa treatments do not help to recover the previously damaged nerve terminals. Furthermore, due to the already decreased presynaptic DA activity, these patients may present a postsynaptic DA supersensitivity5 that would account for the lack of effectiveness and even for the presence of side effects, like Watts et al. reported.14 Some time before, Mizuno et al. had described 4 patients with no CSF examination treated at different unreported ages, but they did not evaluate the impact on movement disturbances.15 Jankovich et al. performed pretreatment CSF analysis, but L-dopa doses and therapy duration were not detailed, age at beginning of the treatment was very variable, and their clinical results were mixed.12",0
"Our clinical observation points out the need to develop neurological therapies for HPRT-deﬁcient patients, among which L-dopa may be promising. However, no general conclusions can be obtained from a single case report, due to LND heterogeneity. In any case, we found that early L-dopa treatment is advisable to enable good",0
"response and to optimize neurological outcome. CSF neurotransmitter analysis may be a useful biochemical aid to select LND patients for L-dopa therapy and monitor their treatment. Further studies, clinical observations, and double-blind trials are needed to establish the usefulness of L-dopa in patients with LND.",0

Although the pathophysiological mechanisms are yet unknown and the involvement of infection and inﬂammation has been discussed,1 several studies have shown the inﬂuence of the dopaminergic system, as antipsychotic agents are successful in the treatment of TS mostly as an antagonist,2 but also partly as an agonist of dopamine.3 Functional and neuroimaging studies emphasize abnormally functioning dopaminergic striato-cortical circuits. To affect these loops in TSpatients, refractory to medical treatment, the strategy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been replaced: introduced by Vandewalle.4 In general, stimulation targets are the thalamus,5,6 the anterior internal capsule,7 the nucleus accumbens8 and the Gpi9–11 (case series by Servello is added), or combined approaches.12",0

After delivery of her son at the age of 20, the symptoms worsened and the patient showed selfmutilation with biting, beating as well as grunting, and screaming. At this time, she also showed compulsive behavior for cleanliness. During the course of disease, the patient regularly developed a depressive mood and agitation proportional to the extent of tics. The intensity of her condition ﬁnally led to three suicide attempts, social isolation, and disability.",0
"For the last 17 years, the patient was continuously treated as inpatient and outpatient of our clinic and the diagnosis of TS was established according to the criteria of DSM-IV.",0
"Conventional medication attempts with a range of antipsychotics over many years did not have any substantial effect. Ultimately, the combination of aripiprazole and tiapride (together with monthly outpatient electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) over the last 5 years) has led to a partial suppression of tics. The rationale for ECT was derived from case reports where a substantial improvement of tics13,14 was demonstrated.",0
"Previous therapies with a-2-adrenoreceptor agonists, dopamine agonists and opioid agonists, as well as alternative treatments like antibiotics, immunoglobulins, and plasmapheresis (already described as possibly effective in single reports15) only resulted in a temporary improvement of the tics.",0

"Before stereotactic intervention, primary symptoms were severe grinding of her teeth, beating her hips, as well as persistent grunting and quacking.",0
"After informed consent, electrode implantation (DBS 3389, Medtronic) for bilateral Gpi-stimulation was performed under propofol anesthesia with MRI-guided stereotaxy using a modiﬁed Leksel/Lerch system. The coordinates of the stereotactic target point were as follows: 3 mm anterior to the AC-PC midpoint, 4 mm below the AC-PC plane, and 20 mm lateral to the intercommisural line. Before the implantatation, three microelectrodes were inserted on each side simultaneously in order to conﬁrm the single-cell activity typical for Gpi and to prove the appropriate distance to the internal capsule by macroelectrode stimulation. A postoperative MRI showed both electrode tips on top of the optic tracts (right electrode 18 mm lateral, 1 mm anterior, 7 mm below midcommissural point; left electrode 19 mm lateral, 1 mm anterior and 5 mm below). On the right side, electrode contact 2 was chosen for chronic stimulation because the deeper contacts caused visual symptoms. On the left side, electrode contact 1 was chosen (Fig. 1). After 5 days, during which the electrode lead had been externalized and further test stimulations had shown no unwanted effects, implantation of the pulse-generators (Soletra, Medtronic) was performed. Initially, standard settings also used in Gpi-DBS for dystonia were chosen (monopolar stimulation, amplitude 2.5 V, pulse width",0
"120 lS, and frequency 130 pps) and slowly increased to",0
"3.2 V at discharge. Stimulation parameters were further increased 3 months after stimulation (3.5 V, 150 lS, 145",0
"pps), 4 months after implantation (3.5 V, 180 lS, 145 pps), and at 12 months after the implantation (4.2 V, 210 lS, 145 pps). Under this setting, the current applied was 94 lA on each side.",0
"A decrease in tic frequency and intensity was noted during the ﬁrst week after the start of the continuous stimulation and tics almost disappeared after 6 weeks of stimulation. Aripiprazole and tiapride were discontinued. Clinical outcome was assessed using the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS), the Verbal Learning Memory Test (VLMT), and the Stroop-Test. The neuropsychological testing before and after the intervention revealed an identical performance proﬁle. The YGTSS score dropped from 83 preoperatively to 28 after 6 weeks and to 10 after 12 months (see Table 1). These 10 points did not result from either motor or phonic score, but from minimal impairment in job functioning.",0
"During the follow-up period of 12 months, the patient did not show tics. For the last 17 years, she never had tic-free periods exceeding 3 weeks.",0
"In the ﬁrst few months after intervention, the patient made frequent visits to our clinic as outpatient complaining of depressive moods, vertigo, and stomach aches. At that time, the patient emphasized having difﬁculties adjusting to the new situation, the absent necessity of being an inpatient and recognizing that the illness had been a big part of her life. We supported her with regular outpatient appointments and centered psychotherapeutic interventions. At present, the patient is stabilized and has begun to engage in previously neglected activities such as horseback riding.",0
We demonstrate full remission of tic symptoms after Gpi-DBS in a patient suffering from intractable TS,0

"with a follow-up period of 12 months. This long-time effectiveness might after all eliminate a placebo effect as the patient was receptive to other invasive treatments in her medical history only temporarily. The cause of therapeutic effects is supposed to be due to a regulation (‘‘override’’) of a possibly disturbed inhibitory output from the basal ganglia to the thalamus. A disturbed Gpi-outﬂow could lead to a disinhibition of excitatory thalamus neurons and consequently to thalamo-cortical hyperactivity.16 A just published case series with 18 TS patients and successful DBS of the thalamus6 represents the ﬁrst publication on a bigger cohort; even when taking this into account, there still is no consensus for the best stimulation target. (Again, Servello‘s report is discussed.)",0
"Although most patients with chronic TS are used to a temporary waxing and waning course of illness or an amelioration of symptoms after medical treatment, the relatively prompt recovery after surgical intervention was problematic for our patient. Psychological interventions are imperative in order to help patients to cope with their ‘‘new life,’’ that is without the symptoms previously dominating their lives.",0
"As demonstrated in patients with Gpi implants for dystonia,17 a low rate of side effects and a good clinical efﬁcacy with this target has been established; therefore, we consider Gpi-DBS as also very promising for the treatment of TS.",0

"Abstract: Friedreich ataxia (FA) is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with expanded GAA repeats in intron 1 of the FRDA gene. Two siblings presented with a mild form of FA at >60 years of age. Both had a large expansion (>600 repeats) and a small expansion (120 repeats) by long-range PCR. Sequence analysis of the small allele revealed multiple, complex interruptions in the GAA repeat. These 2 patients presented later than predicted from their allele size alone, when compared with a large cohort of FA patients. Accounting for the interruptions in the GAA repeat, though, did not make the age of onset consistent with that noted in other patients. Three additional patients with late onset FA and small expanded alleles also exhibited interrupted GAA repeats that were not associated with inappropriately late onset. Our observations suggest that interrupted GAA repeats do not clearly impact the age of onset in FA. © 2008 Movement Disorder Society",0

"tion alleles contain 34 to 65 uninterrupted GAA repeats. Disease-causing alleles contain 66 to 1,700 repeats, with the majority of alleles having 600 to 1,200 repeats. Long stretches of GAA repeats assume a novel DNA structure that interferes with transcription, resulting in decreased expression of the gene product (frataxin).2 Age of symptom onset correlates with the size of the smaller expansion.3 Late onset (26–39 years) and very late onset (>40 years) cases represent atypical presentations of FA.4 Almost all patients, even with the shortest (<100) GAA repeats, have some symptoms by age 40.",0
"In the present work, we present two siblings with onset at >60 years of age with a mild form of the disease. Both had a large expansion ( 600–1,000 repeats) and a small expansion ( 120 repeats) as determined by long-range PCR. In a previously reported similar family, the mild phenotype was explained by the presence of interruptions in the GAA repeats.5 Such interruptions might prevent further expansion by reducing slippage during replication, blocking the formation of the DNA structure that reduces transcription of the frataxin allele, thus leading to improved frataxin expression and less severe disease.2 In the present work, we identiﬁed further patients with interrupted repeats and late onset FA and compared their presentation to that noted in a large cohort of patients with FA.",0
"Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood using the PureGene DNA extraction kit (Gentra Systems) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The region of interest in intron 1 of the FRDA gene was ampliﬁed using the Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche) using primers GAA-F and GAA-R,6 with the following thermal proﬁle: 928C for 2 minutes; 10 cycles of 928C for 20 seconds, 628C for 30 seconds, 688C for 4 minutes; 15 cycles of 928C for 20 seconds, 628C for 30 seconds, 688C for 4 minutes with a 20-second extension per cycle, followed by 1 cycle at 688C for 7 minutes. PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel, and allele sizes were estimated relative to a 500-bp ladder. The shorter expanded alleles were then excised and gel puriﬁed using the Qiaquik Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The extracted product was then reampliﬁed to obtain a large quantity of template for analysis. Products from the second round of PCR were sequenced using the Big Dye Terminator v1.1 sequencing kit. Sequences were analyzed on an automated DNA sequencer (ABI 3100).",0

"This patient presented at age 61 with increasing clumsiness and gradual development of difﬁculty standing on one foot. There was no family history of neurologic disorder, and the patient was not of known Acadian descent. On examination, he was diffusely hyperreﬂexic, particularly in the lower extremities; a Babinski sign was not observed. Diminished vibratory sensation was present to the ankles bilaterally. TSH, B12, folate, and vitamin E levels were normal. Antigliadin and Lyme titers were negative; RPR was nonreactive; electromyography revealed absent sural sensory potentials but intact motor nerve function. Lumbar puncture and MRI imaging of brain, cervical spine and thoracic spine revealed no abnormalities. A genetic test for FA (performed 12 years later) found GAA repeat lengths of 1,034 and 127; these alleles were sized as 1,047 and 114 in a second test. He had a normal EKG, stress test, and electrolyte panel.",0

"Based on previous reports suggesting small interruptions in the GAA repeat in some patients with very late onset of FA, we sequenced the GAA repeat region in a series of patients (Table 1). In sibling Patients 1A and 1B, identical interruptions were identiﬁed in the GAA repeat. The longest uninterrupted repeat was",0
"72 bases. In other patients with short GAA repeats, similar interruptions in the 30 end of the GAA repeat were found in three of four, but the interruptions were less complex. One patient had only a single AAA sequence at the 30 end of the GAA repeat.7–9",0
"We then correlated age of onset with presence or absence of interruptions (Table 2, Fig. 1). Two of 5 patients (Patients 1A and 1B) with interruptions presented later than that expected based on the correlation of total GAA repeat length with age of onset from a large American cohort,10 but 3 patients (Patients 2, 3, and 4) had an age of onset similar to or only slightly later than that predicted based on the overall cohort (see Fig. 1). The patient with the isolated AAA at the",0
30 end of an interrupted repeat (Patient 5) presented,0
"slightly later than the expected age. Similarly, the total maximal uninterrupted length did not correlate substantially better with age of onset. This suggests that the presence of interruptions does not signiﬁcantly affect age of onset.",0
"In this work, a variety of small expanded alleles of the FRDA gene had an altered sequence compared",0
with the normal sequence. GAA repeats in small expanded alleles were interrupted in 5 of 6 patients analyzed with late to very late onset FA. A sixth patient had an AAA expansion at the end of the sequence. All observed interruptions in the GAA repeats were localized to the 30 end of the repeat sequence and were preceded by ‡72 uninterrupted GAA repeats.,0
"The age of onset of FA correlates moderately (r 5 0.60) with the length of the GAA repeat sequence as deﬁned by long-range PCR.10 Although the correlation is lower in the group of patients with GAA repeat lengths shorter than 400, the presence of interruptions did not clearly inﬂuence the age of onset in a simple manner. In the group of patients we identiﬁed with GAA interruptions, patients with identiﬁed interruptions did not consistently have later age of onset than others in the cohort. Although, in this study (and in those reported previously), the initially identiﬁed siblings with interruptions present later than expected, other patients with interruptions did not. Analysis of the age of onset in patients with identiﬁed interruptions using the longest uninterrupted stretch of GAA repeat did not substantially change the relation of age of onset to the typical age of onset based on the entire cohort. Thus, our data here provide no evidence for an effect of interrupted repeats in FA.",0

The age of onset from Patients 1A and 1B remained greater than that predicted based on their repeat length. Patients 2 and 5 had a slightly later age of onset than expected.

In other disorders, the presence of interruptions in repeat sequences has been suggested to modify the expression of disease severity.11–14 We identiﬁed only one patient without a signiﬁcant interruption, showing that in late-onset patients the frequency of interruptions may be quite high. If we examined further patients with late-onset disease as well as patients with short repeats and earlier onset, it might be possible to uncover a modest effect of repeat interruptions with disease features.",0
"In addition, we have analyzed the data at present using simple approaches. Conceivably, features beyond the simple size of uninterrupted repeat (such as interruption structure and complexity) might play a crucial role. Alternatively, speciﬁc phenotypic features might be altered by the presence of interruptions. In addition to having a less progressive course, patients with late onset FA frequently retain reﬂexes (as noted for Patients 1A and 1B here). Still, our data overall are most consistent with the possibility that repeat interruptions do not substantially inﬂuence the age of onset of FA.",0

"Abstract: This study aims to investigate the structure of the motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD), as measured by the Motor Section of the Uniﬁed Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). The dimensionality of the Motor Section of the UPDRS was studied using structural equation modeling. The UPDRS measures were obtained from 405 patients with PD [237 men (39 ‘‘off’’, 170 ‘‘on’’, 28",0

It was shown that the Motor Section of the UPDRS incorporates ﬁve main latent symptom factors (rigidity, tremor, bradykinesia of the extremities, axial/gait bradykinesia, speech/hypomimia) plus two additional factors for laterality, which account for asymmetry of tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia of the extremities.

This paper discusses the dimensionality of the Motor Section of the UPDRS and the structure of motor symptoms of PD within the framework of structural equation modeling (SEM) using conﬁrmatory factor analysis.",0
"In previous studies on dimensionality assessment of the Motor Section of the UPDRS,1–4 between three and six factors were found with percentages of explained total scale variance ranging between 59% and 78%. All these studies used exploratory factor analysis (EFA) methods, principal component analysis included. Such procedures rely on strong assumptions concerning either the distribution of observed variables, their level of measurement, or the number of observations. Principal component analysis requires a continuous measurement level5,6; maximum likelihood estimation in EFA requires continuous measurement levels and either normally distributed item responses or a large number of observations which may compensate for small degrees of nonnormality.7,8 Given the ordinal distributional properties of the items in the Motor Section of the UPDRS, previous conclusions on dimensionality may not be trustworthy because the validity of assumptions of EFA modeling is lacking.",0
"Instead of EFA, we used conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) within a SEM framework to perform a statistical test and to evaluate a number of plausible factor models for the structure of symptoms underlying the Motor Section of the UPDRS. Some SEM estimators are designed for ordinal measurements and thus, in principle, suited for analyzing that structure.",0
PATIENTS AND METHODS,0
Sample,0
"The study includes 405 consecutive patients (237 men, 168 women, mean age 61, range 35–80 years) with PD diagnosed according to current clinical criteria.9 Each patient was evaluated by one member of a group of certiﬁed neurologists, movement disorder specialists who routinely use the UPDRS. Sixty patients were examined in deﬁned ‘‘off’’ state, and 310 patients in deﬁned ‘‘on’’ state. For 35 patients, the motor state during evaluation was not speciﬁed.",0
"This data consists of two subsamples. The ﬁrst subsample of size N 5 147 [96 men (38 ‘‘off’’, 30 ‘‘on’’,",0
"28 unknown) and 51 women (15 ‘‘off’’, 29 ‘‘on’’, 7",0
1308	J. STOCHL ET AL.,0

"‘‘on’’) and 117 women (6 ‘‘off’’, 111 ‘‘on’’)] was acquired at the University Medical Centre Groningen in The Netherlands.",0
Methods,0
"For analyzing the latent structure of the 27 items of the Motor Section of the UPDRS, the LISREL program10 was used. If the level of measurement is ordinal and sample size relatively small, as in our case, Jo¨reskog and So¨rbom11 recommend analyzing the matrix of estimated polychoric correlations of the observed variables along with the estimated matrix of asymptotic covariances of those estimated correlations, and to apply robust diagonally weighted least squares (DWLS) model estimation. The polychoric correlations and the asymptotic covariance matrix were computed using the PRELIS program.12",0
"A number of theoretically meaningful models were compared. For the ‘‘ﬁnal’’ model described here, the path diagram with standardized parameter estimates, the matrix of estimated polychoric correlations, goodness-of-ﬁt statistics and indices, a summary of estimated standard errors of the parameter estimates, and the ﬁtted residual matrix are reported; for details see Ref. 13.",0
"The ‘‘ﬁnal’’ model of the Motor Section of the UPDRS is shown in Figure 1. A number of theoretically plausible models were tested and compared before the model in Figure 1 was chosen as a most plausible one.13 Following that conclusion, based on both model estimates and theoretical PD background considerations, the Motor Section of the UPDRS consists of seven factors. Five of them are substantive, each reﬂecting a PD motor symptom—tremor, rigidity (Rig), bradykinesia of the extremities (Brad), axial/gait bradykinesia (BBrad), and speech/hypomimia (Face). Two additional factors (Left and Right) reﬂect the asymmetry of tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia of the extremities.",0
"Although some ﬁtted residuals (see Table 1) remained high, the ﬁt statistics and indices suggest that this model need not to be rejected. Generally, the values of comparative ﬁt index (CFI) and goodness of ﬁt index (GFI) suggest a very acceptable ﬁt, whereas root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), standardized  root  mean  square  residual  (SRMR),  and",0
"normed ﬁt index (NFI) indicate slightly less, but still acceptable model ﬁt (see the values below Fig. 1). Values in the matrix of residual correlations are ranging from 20.40 to 0.34 (median of absolute value 0.04, standard deviation 0.07). The highest ﬁtted residuals are those between action tremor items (right hand and left hand; 0.34), and surprisingly, between item action tremor—left hand and item Tremor—right lower extremity (20.40). Values of factor loadings range from",0
"0.11 to 0.92 (median 0.64, standard deviation 0.19); see Figure 1. The lowest factor loading (0.11) is for item tremor—right lower extremity as an indicator for latent factor Right; although the corresponding parameter test statistic is nonsigniﬁcant (standard error 0.17), it is theoretically meaningful to keep this parameter free. In general, values of estimated standard errors of the parameter estimates ranged from 0.02 to 0.17 (median 0.07, standard deviation 0.04). The estimated composite reliability of our model (by stratiﬁed coefﬁcient alpha14) equals 0.94.",0
"The four factors of rigidity, bradykinesia of the extremities, speech/hypomimia, and axial/gait bradykinesia are correlated, which is meaningful from a theoretical point of view. The correlations range between 0.54 and 0.85 (see Fig. 1) indicating rather substantial relationships among these symptom factors. Tremor, however, seems to be a PD symptom occurring independently of other motor PD symptom factors.",0

"The models were estimated using the DWLS estimator, mainly because of the ordinal measurement level of the items and the relatively small sample size.",0
"Several studies1–4,15 assessed the construct validity and the dimensionality of the Motor Section of the UPDRS through EFA. As discussed earlier, neither EFA nor some of the CFA estimators are the most appropriate scaling techniques, because the assumptions of the underlying statistical model may easily be violated. In previous dimensionality studies of the UPDRS, sample sizes N < 300 were often used.1–3,15 In addition, measurement of the UPDRS is obviously of ordinal rather than continuous type, which may pose problems when using regular maximum likelihood estimation and PCA.6 To our knowledge, the only study where the measurement level of the UPDRS data was respected is one by Kroonenberg et al.16 However, their study primarily focused on the differences in the structure of PD motor signs for ‘‘on’’ and ‘‘off’’ patients; the results appeared to depend on the motor state of the patient. Their model did not ﬁt our data, which might be due to a different scoring practice, a problem that might also account for different validity and reliability results of the UPDRS across countries.",0
"The two factors of laterality (Left and Right) reﬂect the asymmetry of occurrence of tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia of the extremities. In a clinical cohort it has been shown that initial PD symptoms start more frequently on the right-sided extremities than on the left.17 In some EFA studies, side-sensitivity of bradykinesia of the extremities was mentioned before,2,3 as well as that of action/postural tremor.1 To our knowledge, side-sensitivity of rigidity and rest tremor, however, has not been previously reported.",0
"The high correlations among the factors rigidity, bradykinesia of the extremities, axial/gait bradykinesia, and speech/hypomimia can be indicators of co-occurrence of these PD symptoms. For most patients in common PD populations, however, the main symptoms co-occur whereas isolated tremor may only be present in very early stages of PD. Further, the relative independence of tremor from rigidity and bradykinesia can be viewed as an indicator of the lack of substantive relationship between tremor and PD disability, a ﬁnding consistent with other reports.18,19",0
"Since a number of theoretically meaningful models were compared, implying a partly exploratory result, future cross-validation is necessary to challenge our ‘‘ﬁnal’’ factor structure of the Motor Section of the UPDRS. It should also be realized that larger sample sizes would make model estimation results, especially",0
"when considering the ordinal character of item responses, more reliable and ﬁnal conclusions more valid.",0

"This 65-year-old woman fell after tripping over a concrete block on the pavement, causing disﬁguring soft tissue injuries above her right orbit. Apart from migraine, there were no other medical problems at the time, and no psychiatric history. There was no documented injury or pain in the neck or back following the fall, and at that time, she was neurologically normal. Legal action relating to the circumstances of the incident was initiated. A reconstructive right blepharoplasty was performed for right sided pseudoptosis. She subsequently developed a right frontal headache. The cosmetic results of the surgery were insufﬁcient and it was revised by browplasty that required the placement of three surgical screws into the right frontal bone, including one that penetrated the frontal air sinus. The surgery was complicated by chronic pain around the operational site that was partially relieved by neck massage. Eighteen months after the fall, and following massage of the neck she developed disabling paroxysms of axial, ﬂexor jerks that were most severe when lying supine. There was a suggestion of associated left-sided weakness at onset, but this resolved and MRI and angiogram were normal. At ﬁrst the jerks occurred several times per day, but rapidly increased in frequency, with bouts of continuous jerking lasting for up to 1 hour, causing signiﬁcant disability. There was positive, action myoclonus with coexistent stimulus sensitive myoclonus of variable latency, which diminished with distraction. Increasingly her mobility became affected by jerking and unsteady gait. There were periods of complete remission lasting up to several months. Jerking was exacerbated by anxiety, but no other precipitants were identiﬁed. Spinal cord and brain MRI were normal except for a few scattered deep white matter ischemic changes. Psychiatric evaluation did not identify features of somatization, depression, or malingering. She incompletely responded to piracetam 16 g per day, clonazepam 4 mg per day, sodium valproate 2 g per day, and baclofen. Three surgical screws used in the blepharoplasty were removed 4",0

Electrophysiological Investigations,0
"Two years after the onset of jerking, routine EEG was normal. Median nerve sensory evoked potentials were normal. A jerk locked back averaged EEG did not show pre-movement cortical potentials. An order of activation study showed variable muscle activation, but the most frequent pattern of activation was caudal, from pectoral to abdominal muscles, with propagation estimated at 9 to 15 m/s. (see Figure 1) EMG burst length was between 50 and 150 milliseconds.",0
"This patient had some clinical and electrophysiological ﬁndings consistent with previous reports of PSM, as well as features not usually reported to be associated, such as gait unsteadiness and axial jerks while standing. Unusually for PSM there were periods of spontaneous remission and no identiﬁable pathological lesion to",0
"account for the myoclonus. The sudden onset, contemporaneous legal proceedings related to the injury, the associated anxiety and spontaneous, complete remission are supportive of a psychogenic etiology.4",0
"The electrophysiological ﬁndings reported in PSM include ﬁxed patterns of muscle activation, slow spinal cord conduction (5–15 m/s), EMG burst duration less than 1,000 ms and synchronous activation of agonist and antagonist muscles (reviewed in Ref. 3). In our case, the short EMG burst duration and slow conduction was consistent with these reports. In a number of similar cases, with electrophysiological characteristics of ‘‘organic’’ PSM, the possibility of psychogenic etiology has been raised.3,5 Healthy volunteers simulating PSM have electrophysiological recordings that are also similar, except for long EMG burst durations.3 The ﬁndings in the present study support these authors’ contention that electrophysiological parameters alone are insufﬁcient to identify ‘‘organic’’ PSM. To our knowledge, remissions have not been reported in PSM, and are said to count against the diagnosis.6",0
"The patient felt certain that the surgical screws caused the myoclonic jerks, but we were unable to identify a biological mechanism to account for this. Psychogenic PSM is the most likely diagnosis, and removal of the perceived precipitant was curative in this case. The clinical and imaging ﬁndings together with the long follow-up in this patient effectively exclude any other diagnostic possibilities.",0
"A psychogenic etiology should be considered when patients develop axial ﬂexor jerks that occur when lying and standing without identiﬁable central nervous system lesions, even in the presence of suggestive electrophysiological ﬁndings. Spontaneous remissions may differentiate psychogenic and organic PSM.",0

"Abstract: Episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2) is an autosomaldominant hereditary disorder clinically characterized by recurrent attacks of vertigo, imbalance and ataxia. Studies have shown that 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) is capable to prevent these attacks. However, there are no reports whether 4-AP is able to attenuate interictal cerebellar ataxia. Using the scale for assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA), we examined the efﬁcacy of 4-AP on interictal ataxia in a 63year-old female patient who suffered from EA2 since the age of 57. EA2 was diagnosed based on clinical criteria and not genetically proven. When treatment with 4-AP was paused the patient was suffering from marked gait and stance ataxia. After re-initiation of treatment with 5 mg 4AP t.i.d., there was pronounced improvement in gait and stance ataxia. Within 24 hours SARA score lowered from",0

"50. Affected patients suffer from recurrent attacks of vertigo, imbalance and ataxia, which may last for several hours up to days and can often be provoked by physical exertion, emotional stress and consumption of caffeine or alcohol. Most patients show central ocular motor disturbances between these attacks such as gazeholding deﬁcits, downbeat nystagmus, saccadic eye pursuit movements and impaired visual suppression of the vestibulo-ocular reﬂex.2 Interictal cerebellar symptoms are a common condition in the course of the disease1 and can be so marked that patients become wheelchairbound. Because EA2 is allelic with familial hemiplegic migraine type 1, half of the patients suffer from migraine headaches. In the majority of cases, there is a positive family history for the disease.2",0
"Acetazolamide (ACTZ) is the drug of ﬁrst choice for treatment of EA2 and prevents or attenuates the attacks in 50 to 75% of all patients. However, many patients stop treatment with ACTZ in the long run due to adverse effects, such as nephrolithiasis, hyperhydrosis, paresthesia, muscle stiffness, and gastrointestinal disturbance, or because of a loss of efﬁcacy. So far, treatment options for these patients are limited. 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP), a potassium channel blocker, has recently shown to be capable to prevent or markedly attenuate attacks of ataxia in patients in whom treatment with ACTZ had failed.3 However, there are so far no reports whether 4-AP is able to attenuate interictal progressive cerebellar ataxia that is often a key clinical feature in elderly EA2 patients.",0
"We examined a 63-year-old female patient who contacted our Movement Disorder Outpatient Clinic in May 2004. In 2000, at the age of 57, she started to suffer from attacks with vertigo, nausea, and vomiting that were sometimes accompanied by dysarthria and headaches. These attacks initially lasted for about 30 min but prolonged within subsequent years. Additionally, she had problems with visual ﬁxation of objects and often had the impression that her visual image was rolling away. Consumption of coffee or alcoholic beverages led to deterioration of symptoms. In 2006, the attacks completely ceased and interictal gait ataxia became the main clinical problem making her incapable of walking or standing without support. In the past, the patient had suffered from migraine headaches. The mother of the patient also suffered from vertigo",0

"and headaches, a half-sister complained about chronic headaches.",0
"Clinical examination revealed central oculomotor deﬁcits such as spontaneous nystagmus to the left as well as downbeat nystagmus at gaze to the left, saccadic pursuit movements and impaired visual suppression of the vestibular-ocular reﬂex. Additionally, we observed dysmetria during the nose–ﬁnger test and heel–shin slide as well as marked stance and gait ataxia. Magnetic resonance imaging showed decent atrophy of the upper vermis of the cerebellum but no further pathology, electroencephalography was normal. Tumor screening including serum tumor markers was negative; analysis of cerebrospinal ﬂuid did not show any abnormalities. Vestibular dysfunction was excluded as possible reason for vertigo by otorhinolaryngologic examination that demonstrated regular function of both vestibular organs. There was no sign for baroreceptor or orthostatic dysfunction during autonomic testing including metronomic breathing, Valsalva maneuver and passive orthostasis on the tilt table. Since the patient did not undergo genetic testing, EA2 was diagnosed clinically based on the medical history and the typical clinical ﬁndings mentioned above.",0
"Treatment was initiated with ACTZ in December 2003 but had to be ceased due to tinnitus and paresthesia of hands and feet. During treatment with ACTZ the patient had been able to ﬁxate objects better than before, whereas ataxia remained unchanged. Starting from July 2006, we administered 5 mg 4-AP t.i.d. (provided by Synopharm, Germany), which was well tolerated without any adverse effects but initially did not seem to have any subjective beneﬁt for the patient. After 4-AP had been withdrawn due to suspected lack of efﬁcacy after only 14 days of treatment and without further clinical evaluation, the patient returned within 1 week and reported about a distinct worsening of gait and stance ataxia making her unable to walk unassisted. After re-initiation of 4-AP, symptoms markedly improved and are now stable over 1 year.",0
Evaluations,0
"After informed consent for videotaping had been given, the patient was asked to pause treatment with 4AP for 24 hours and after that was videotaped and rated according to the recently validated scale for the assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA).4 The patient was then given a single dose of 5 mg 4-AP and videotaped and rated again as soon as she realized improvement of her symptoms. A ﬁnal evaluation was done after the patient had taken 3 3 5 mg 4-AP over 24",0
"hours. All evaluations were done in exact order as provided by SARA. The videotapes were reviewed by a movement disorder expert (A.S.) who was blinded for the treatment. Scores were given according to the SARA criteria based on a common judgment of the expert and the observer who had videotaped the patient (M.L.). ECG was performed before and during treatment to exclude clinically relevant prolongation of QTC time, which was calculated using Bazett’s correction: QTc ¼ QT ðmillisecondsÞ= RR ðsecondsÞ. QTC time was within normal range measuring 429 milliseconds before and 414 milliseconds during treatment with 5 mg 4-AP t.i.d.",0
"After 24 hours withdrawal of 4-AP, the patient was suffering from marked gait and stance ataxia (Video), minimal speech disturbance, slight dysmetria during ﬁnger chase with the left hand, tremor during the noseﬁnger test on both sides and a slightly abnormal heel– shin slide. Because of gait ataxia she preferred to use a walker in order to avoid falls. Total SARA score without 4-AP was 8.5 points. One hour after intake of a single dose of 5 mg 4-AP, the patient noticed a slight relief of her symptoms that could only be objectiﬁed during the nose–ﬁnger test (SARA subscore decreased from 1.0 to 0.5 points) where she had less tremor of her right hand (total SARA score: 8.0 points).",0
"On the next day, after completing her regular daily treatment with 5 mg 4-AP t.i.d., the patient returned to our outpatient clinic without her walker. Gait had markedly stabilized, so she was even able to do some steps of tandem walking (Video). Stance ataxia also had improved (SARA subscore decreased from 2.0 to 1.0 points), the patient was now capable of standing with her feet in tandem position for more than 10 seconds (Video). Furthermore, there was improvement in ﬁnger chase, nose–ﬁnger test and heel–shin slide. Total SARA score after treatment with 4-AP t.i.d. had lowered to 4.5 points.",0
"Our report conﬁrms previous observations that 4-AP treatment offers an option for EA2 patients in whom ACTZ failed to relieve symptoms. Although 4-AP in previous studies has shown to be effective in preventing or attenuating ataxia attacks,3 our report for the ﬁrst time suggests that 4-AP may also be beneﬁcial for patients with late onset of EA2 in whom interictal cerebellar ataxia has become the key clinical feature.",0
"Because of the CACNA1A mutation, current density from Cav2.1 channels in EA2 is reduced, which may lead to a general reduction in Purkinje cell ﬁring rates and a loss of inhibition at deep cerebellar nuclei.5 Ani-",0
1316	M. LO¨HLE ET AL.,0
"mal studies in guinea pigs have demonstrated that 4AP is able to increase the excitability of Purkinje cells by reducing the duration of the slowly depolarizing potential and thus latency to the ﬁring of Ca21 spikes in response to intracellular current pulses.6 Thus, it may be assumed that the beneﬁcial effects of 4-AP are due to its capability to restore overall Purkinje cell excitability and thereby inhibitory effects of Purkinje cells on deep cerebellar nuclei.5",0
"Our patient reported symptomatic relief 1 hour after the ingestion of 5 mg 4-AP, which is in keeping with pharmacokinetic studies that found maximal plasma concentrations 1.0–1.2 hours after intake.7 However, improvement at that time point was only visible during the ﬁnger–nose test and was much more marked after 4AP had been taken three times a day. This observation may indicate that neuronal circuits affected by EA2 need time to adjust to 4-AP before symptomatic effects can be measured. The initial lack of subjective beneﬁt after the ﬁrst administration of 4-AP might as well have been due to the short duration of initial treatment since therapy with 4-AP supported by regular gait and balance training now shows a long-lasting effect over 1 year.",0
Future treatment trials are warranted to evaluate and compare the therapeutic effects of ACTZ and 4-AP. These trials should examine the efﬁcacy of both drugs on attacks as well as on interictal ataxia in order to identify the best treatment for patients of various ages and different disease stages.,0

"Abstract: Stereotactic neurosurgeons hesitate to employ sedation in cases requiring microelectrode recording (MER). We report our experience with dexmedetomidine during MER of subthalamic nucleus (STN). Eleven Parkinsonian patients received dexmedetomidine during deep brain stimulation surgery. Seven received continuous IV infusions during MER in the STN. The bispectral index (BIS) was used to estimate the level of consciousness. The quality of MER was evaluated as a function of BIS, clinical arousal, and dexmedetomidine dose. MER during wakefulness (BIS > 80; 0.1 to 0.4 mcg/kg/hr dexmedetomidine) was similar to the unmedicated state. Subthalamic MER was reduced when the patient was asleep or unarousable (BIS < 80). Anxiolysis persisted for hours. Arousal affects STN neurons. Dexmedetomidine ‘‘cooperative sedation,’’ from which the patient is easily aroused, provides interpretable STN MER and prolonged anxiolysis. We suggest dexmedetomidine infusions without a loading dose, a relatively low infusion rate, and discontinuation after completion of the bur holes. © 2008 Movement Disorder Society",0

"operative testing require an awake, cooperative patient.2,3 Patients fear awake surgical procedures, but many stereotactic neurosurgeons remain hesitant to employ sedation for fear of suppressing symptoms or attenuating localizing signals.",0
"Sedation during MER-guided DBS surgery poses a real challenge as even small doses of sedatives can affect the quality of MER4 or suppress PD symptoms.5 Patient comfort would no doubt be maximized by general anesthesia, but probably at the expense of precise electrode positioning and clinical efﬁcacy. Maltete et al. reported generally successful DBS implants with general anesthesia in 15 Parkinson’s disease patients, but motor score improvements postoperatively were lower in the anesthetized group.6 Hertel et al. recently reported decreased background of STN MER in a setting of carefully titrated general anesthesia.7",0
Dexmedetomidine (Precedex) is an attractive seda-,0
"tive for use in neurosurgical procedures, because of its minimal respiratory depressant effects, hemodynamic stabilizing properties, and rapid onset and offset. Initially approved for ICU sedation, this a-2 agonist affects receptors primarily in the locus ceruleus with minimal effects on cerebral cortex.8 This results in a unique ‘‘cooperative sedation’’ where patients may ‘‘fall asleep’’ but are easily aroused.9",0

"Stefani et al. found that spontaneous sleep can have a profound impact on the discharge of STN neurons.11 This suggests that behavioral arousal could play a clinically relevant role in MER localization. Because patients may ‘‘fall asleep’’ even with low doses of dexmedetomidine, sleep/waking state may be a factor related to anxiolysis rather than frank sedation.",0

Surgery,0
"Parkinson medications were held on the day of surgery, and a Leksell stereotactic frame was placed using local anesthesia. Direct targeting was based on T2 and MP-RAGE volumetric MR.12 The patient was placed in a semirecumbent position with the frame locked to the operating table. Blood pressure was monitored by an automatic cuff. Spontaneous respiration was monitored along with O2 saturation.",0
Sedation,0
"Sedation was provided with continuous infusion of intravenous dexmedetomidine, which usually started at",0
"0.7 mcg/(kg hr) and titrated down based on clinical response. In several patients, an initial loading dose of 1 mcg/kg was administered over 20 min. Level of consciousness was assessed by the neurosurgeon and anesthesiologist using observation and verbal questioning. The bispectral index (BIS) helped to estimate the level of cortical arousal13:",0
"BIS 5 80 to 100 suggests awake and alert, BIS 5 60 to 80 varying levels of sedation, and BIS 5 40 to 60 general anesthesia.",0
Sedation was titrated to patient comfort and was transiently increased during bur hole placement. No other drugs with sedative properties were administered.,0
Microelectrode Recording,0
"MER was initiated 25-mm above the target and recorded on an Alpha Omega system. Sample recordings were saved every 0.5-mm during the trajectory. We did not test for motor driving of neurons. Following satisfactory MER and intraoperative macrostimulation testing, the DBS electrode was anchored in position and conﬁrmed with ﬂuoroscopy.",0
Postoperative,0

"Eleven Parkinsonian patients underwent MERguided STN DBS with intravenous dexmedetomidine. All were men, average age 62.3 years, mean disease",0
duration 10.1 years. Eight patients underwent bilateral and three underwent unilateral surgery.,0
"Microelectrode recordings were successful for all placements. The mean number of electrode trajectories per side was 1.5 (range 1–4). The mean trajectory length through the subthalamic nucleus was 4.4 mm (range 2.5–6 mm). In 4 patients, dexmedetomidine sedation was discontinued following bur hole placement, the most noxious part of the procedure. The other 7 patients received intravenous dexmedetomidine during microelectrode recording in the subthalamic nucleus.",0
Subthalamic MER signals equivalent to the nonsedated state were obtained when dexmedetomidine was titrated to an easily arousable level of consciousness (BIS > 80). Suppression of subthalamic neuronal discharge occurred with higher infusion rates and sedation levels where the patient was unarousable (BIS < 80) (Figs. 1 and 2). All patients were sufﬁciently alert and cooperative for macrostimulation testing following microelectrode recording.,0
"Following dexmedetomidine administration, and up to at least several hours after discontinuation, we observed a prolonged anxiolytic effect. It was relatively common for these patients to lapse into easily arousable sleep during the later stages of the operation. In some patients we observed a clear step-change increase in MER activity in the STN upon behavioral arousal from sleep, consistent with the report by Stefani et al.11",0
"Eleven Parkinsonian patients received dexmedetomidine sedation during DBS surgery, and localizing unit activity was recorded from STN in every case. MER of STN was obtained during continuous infusion in 7 of these patients. Low level infusions of dexmedetomidine [~0.1 mcg/(kg hr)] did not substantially suppress",0

"FIG. 2. Deep sedation suppresses STN neuronal activity. All traces were recorded from the same microelectrode position. Upper trace: STN MER signals. Patient is awake with BIS 5 95. Middle trace: MER signals following an IV bolus of dexmedetomidine [1 lg/kg load over 10 min, then 0.5 lg/(kg hr)]. Patient becomes unarousable with BIS 5 70. Lower trace: MER signals 20 min after stopping dexmedetomidine infusion. Patient awakens with some return of baseline background activity, BIS 5 95.",0
"STN neuronal discharges, but higher rates [ 0.5 mcg/ (kg hr)] resulted in a deeper sedation (lower BIS levels) and suppressed neuronal ﬁring in the STN (see Fig. 1).",0
"The clinical OR setting of these recordings imposed some constraints on analysis of neuronal activity. High-amplitude single-cell activity is lost over time at a given position of the microelectrode. MER across different medication or arousal conditions typically required 10 min or more, longer than we could reliably hold the activity of discriminable single units.",0
"The so-called background multiple cell activity is more stable over time, and may be a marker of pharmacologic modulation.7 We were able to obtain continuous MER of the STN during relatively rapid changes from sleep to waking, and on one occasion before and after a bolus infusion of dexmedetomidine (see Fig. 2). We could not obtain MER activity during the transition from medicated to nonmedicated, or from wakefulness to sleep because these are not rapid events. There is thus an inevitable confounding of the effect of time with the effect of the manipulation, particularly of drug levels. We hope that future research may provide more details of the effects of arousal versus pharmacologic effects on STN neurons.",0
"Rozet et al. reported that patient comfort was improved with intravenous dexmedetomidine and MER of the subthalamic nucleus was possible. We agree. However, we observed that subthalamic neuronal ﬁring varied with the dose of intravenous dexmedetomidine and the patient’s level of behavioral arousal.",0
Intravenous dexmedetomidine was highly successful in alleviating anxiety during all stages of DBS surgery,0
"and particularly for placement of the bur holes. The terminal elimination half-life of dexmedetomidine is recognized as 2 hours, but we observed prolonged, clinically effective anxiolysis even when the infusion was discontinued several hours earlier. We did not observe a beneﬁt with continuous infusion of dexmedetomidine after placement of the bur holes.",0
"There were no apparent complications from the medication. Mild hypotension has been reported with loading doses, and our practice has evolved to utilize dexmedetomidine infusions without a loading dose, maintain a relatively low infusion rate, and discontinue the infusion immediately after the completion of the bur holes. The need for hypotensive agents to maintain normotension during electrode placement appeared to be reduced in these patients. Vasopressors were not required in any of the cases in our series.",0
"Our experience indicates that dexmedetomidine can be used safely to sedate patients with Parkinson’s disease during DBS placement without signiﬁcant effect on the intraoperative localizing value of MER. Steadystate infusion rates of 0.1 to 0.4 mcg/(kg /hr) seem appropriate, with infusion rates titrated to maintain BIS values above 80, discontinuation after placement of bur holes, and the patient kept awake and alert during MER.",0
CONCLUSIONS,0
STN MER activity may vary with behavioral arousal.,0
Intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine titrated to easy arousability will allow quality STN MER in the awake and alert patient.,0

Higher doses of dexmedetomidine which produce deep sedation (BIS  80 and patient unarousable) will suppress STN MER signals.,0

"DISCUSSION We describe the case of a child affected with LND presenting clinical signs of impaired CNS dopaminergic function. The notable tremor, the marked dystonia developed during early infancy, and the obvious sustained response to L-dopa led us to investigate a primary dopaminergic defect. However, some clinical characteristics such as the absence of oculogyric crisis and the preservation of facial gesticulation did not ﬁt into a primary dopaminergic defect picture.",0
"The role of neurotransmitters in brain development has recently been documented.8 Interestingly, the early dopaminergic input from the midbrain may play an important role in the development of the basal ganglia and cerebral cortex.9 Furthermore, brain development has to be completed during the ﬁrst months of life, when axonal and dendritic branching is ongoing and synaptogenesis is just beginning.

Conventional medication attempts with a range of antipsychotics over many years did not have any substantial effect. Ultimately, the combination of aripiprazole and tiapride (together with monthly outpatient electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) over the last 5 years) has led to a partial suppression of tics. The rationale for ECT was derived from case reports where a substantial improvement of tics13,14 was demonstrated.",0

She returned to normal function and was symptom free at follow-up 2 years later. Electrophysiological Investigations",0
"Two years after the onset of jerking, routine EEG was normal. Median nerve sensory evoked potentials were normal. A jerk locked back averaged EEG did not show pre-movement cortical potentials. An order of activation study showed variable muscle activation, but the most frequent pattern of activation was caudal, from pectoral to abdominal muscles, with propagation estimated at 9 to 15 m/s. (see Figure 1) EMG burst length was between 50 and 150 milliseconds. DISCUSSION",0
"This patient had some clinical and electrophysiological ﬁndings consistent with previous reports of PSM, as well as features not usually reported to be associated, such as gait unsteadiness and axial jerks while standing. Unusually for PSM there were periods of spontaneous remission and no identiﬁable pathological lesion to account for the myoclonus. The sudden onset, contemporaneous legal proceedings related to the injury, the associated anxiety and spontaneous, complete remission are supportive of a psychogenic etiology.4",0
"A psychogenic etiology should be considered when patients develop axial ﬂexor jerks that occur when lying and standing without identiﬁable central nervous system lesions, even in the presence of suggestive electrophysiological ﬁndings.

Until recently, its diagnosis was based on distinctive MRI features, such as white matter lesions that predominantly affect the frontotemporal and periventricular regions. The ﬁnding of causative mutations in the GFAP gene has enabled diagnostic conﬁrmation by mutation analysis. This has also lead to the identiﬁcation of atypical and late-onset cases, with a highly variable spectrum of clinical and imaging abnormalities.",0
"We report a case of an adult-onset, mutation proven Alexander disease characterized by cerebellar and sensory ataxia, the absence of palatal tremor, and very mild white matter changes.1,2",0
"This 61-year-old man presented at the age of 50 years with slowly progressive gait difﬁculties. His past medical history revealed the onset of static but marked forward ﬂexion of the trunk in his ﬁrst decade, but without any motor abnormalities until recently. His sister had been diagnosed with progressive cerebellar ataxia; there were no other affected relatives.",0
"Neurological examination (see video) revealed a normal mental status; jerky pursuit, and dysmetric saccades; mild cerebellar dysarthria; mild ataxia of the trunk and extremities that increased upon eye closure; a broad-based, ataxic gait; cervical kyphosis and thoracic scoliosis with ﬂexion contractures of the hips and knees; positive Romberg’s sign; disturbed vibration sense in the lower limbs; slightly diminished tendon reﬂexes in the lower extremities with normal plantar responses.",0
"We screened for several of the genetic ataxias, but no mutations were detected in the SCA1/2/3/6/7/14 genes or in the genes responsible for Friedreich’s ataxia and dentatorubro-pallido-luysian atrophy. Electromyography showed no signs of neuropathy or myopathy. SSEP was not performed. MRI demonstrated subtle white matter lesions anteriorly in both temporal lobes, as well as mild atrophy of the cerebellum, brainstem and cervical spinal cord on standard MRI imaging (Fig. 1A–C).",0

"The records of the affected sister, who died at the age of 64, mentioned horizontal nystagmus, cerebellar dysarthria, limb ataxia, and progressive gait difﬁculties. In addition, the presence of palatal myoclonus was noted once. While the dysarthria was said to exist from an early age, the gait difﬁculties arose at the age of 30. Brain imaging (at age 58 years) showed cerebellar and marked bulbomedullar atrophy as well as white matter lesions in the periventricular region, corpus callosum, and right medial cerebellar peduncle (Fig. 1D–F).",0
"As these combined clinical and imaging features were suggestive of Alexander disease, we sequenced the GFAP gene, and found a novel heterozygous c.692T > A missense mutation in exon 4, predicting a p.Leu231His amino acid change; this mutation was not encountered in 210 control chromosomes.",0
"Several cases of adult-onset Alexander disease have been reported, mostly with an onset in the third or fourth decade of life. Phenotypic heterogeneity is evident from the variable presence of bulbar symptoms, cerebellar signs, palatal tremor, spastic paresis, and autonomic dysfunction.",0
"The index patient reported here displays a rather unique phenotype of adult-onset Alexander disease. First, his age at onset was 50 years, which is one of the latest ever reported.3 Second, his clinical presentation was dominated by the combined presence of slowly progressive cerebellar and sensory ataxia, in the absence of palatal tremor. The kyphoscoliosis and his knee-bent posture are very likely related to his Alexander disease, as these features have been observed previously.4–13 Yet, the interval to the onset of ataxia in our case is remarkable. Third, neuroimaging in our patient revealed cerebellar, brainstem, and spinal cord atrophy—all previously reported imaging features of Alexander disease— but the white matter changes were extremely subtle, involving a minor portion of the anterior poles of both temporal lobes only. MRI abnormalities in adult-onset Alexander disease are heterogeneous, but the white matter changes are generally less extensive compared with the classic early-onset disease.17",0
"The give-away in this case was the presence of a PAPT syndrome in the patient’s sister. The combination of cerebellar ataxia and palatal tremor is relatively common in adultonset Alexander disease (43%).4,9–12,14 This clinical constellation is presently referred to as PAPT (progressive ataxia and palatal tremor), used to indicate a subgroup of the symptomatic palatal tremor in which neurodegenerative diseases are involved. In case of a familial PAPT, the differential diagnosis is quite limited and, in addition to Alexander disease, also includes SCA20 and perhaps other forms of degenerative cerebellar ataxias.15,16",0
"In conclusion, we report two sibs with late-onset ataxia due to Alexander disease caused by a novel GFAP mutation. Alexander disease should thus be considered in the differential diagnosis of otherwise unexplained hereditary late-onset",0

Antihistamine-Associated Myoclonus: A Case Report,0
"Myoclonus is a clinical sign deﬁned as sudden, brief, shocklike, involuntary movements caused by muscular contractions (positive myoclonus) or inhibitions (negative myoclonus, asterixis). Most causes of myoclonus are symptomatic and include posthypoxia, toxic-metabolic disorders, and neurodegenerative disorders.1 Various drugs, including neuroleptics, anticonvulsants, and cardiac medications, can cause myoclonus,1,2 but antihistamine-associated myoclonus is extremely rare.2,3 Here, we report a case of transient myoclonus triggered by an antihistamine, oxatomide.",0
"An 85-year-old man taking amlodipine (5 mg/day), candesartan (8 mg/day), arotinolol (20 mg/day), and furosemide (20 mg/day) for hypertension, and allopurinol (200 mg/day) for hyperuricemia, developed an involuntary movement in his right hand. It progressed over his upper limbs and face within several hours, and he was referred to our hospital. On physical examination, he was afebrile without abnormality, except for systolic hypertension (170/80 mm Hg). The mini-mental status test revealed cognitive impairment (score 20). At rest there was myoclonus in the patient’s face, tongue, jaw, neck, and upper limbs, predominantly on the left. There was no palatal tremor. An electrophysiological study revealed 4-Hz rhythmic myoclonic discharges in the left arm muscles with synchronized ocular movement that increased with eyelid closure (see Fig. 1), and suggested that the myoclonus was persistent and time-locked in all locations (generalized myo-",0

"clonus). Limb myoclonus was exaggerated when the patient extended his upper limbs, but it was not induced by external sensory stimuli. The involuntary movements were not suppressed by mental stress or by alternate pronation and supination of the forearm to an external rhythm. Asterixis was evident when the patient’s upper limbs were extended and his wrists dorsiﬂexed, and it caused the lapse in posture between the positive myoclonic jerks. He was unable to maintain his tongue in the protruded position owing to asterixis of the tongue, and he had difﬁculty speaking. Neurological examination was otherwise normal. Laboratory examination revealed a mild elevation of urea nitrogen (25 mg/dL) and aspartate aminotransferase (40 IU/L), but the plasma ammonia concentration and thyroid function were normal. Chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly, and cardiac ultrasonography showed left ventricular hypertrophy and mild mitral regurgitation. The plasma brain natriuretic peptide concentration was 189.0 pg/mL. Abdominal sonography and computed tomography revealed no abnormality, and there was no portalsystemic shunt. Cerebrospinal ﬂuid analysis was normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed diffuse cerebral atrophy, which was consistent with Alzheimer’s disease, and an old ischemic lesion in the right cerebellum. Electroencephalography showed a 9-Hz alpha background rhythm without epileptiform activity. The involuntary movements disappeared immediately after the intravenous administration of 10 mg diazepam.",0

The ﬁrst myoclonus occurred after 18 days’ use of oxatomide (120 mg/day), and the second occurred after 8 days’ use of oxatomide (120 mg/day) and epinastine (20 mg/day) for chronic prurigo. The myoclonus has not recurred since the patient stopped the antihistamines.",0
"Our patient ﬁrst presented with acute occurrences of both generalized myoclonus and asterixis, predominantly in the face, neck, and upper limbs. The involuntary movements disappeared immediately after benzodiazepine treatment, but he experienced a recurrence. These clinical features are similar to the ‘‘transient myoclonic state with asterixis’’ previously reported by Hashimoto et al.4 The cause of that state is unclear, although aging, chronic diseases, and viral infection could contribute. However, in our patient, the temporal relationship between myoclonus and the antihistamine medication history suggests that oxatomide triggered the movement disorder. Oxatomide, a second-generation antihistamine, is used to treat allergic diseases in Europe and Japan. Its pharmacologic actions include histamine H1-receptor antagonism and suppression of the production and release of chemical mediators, as well as anti-cholinergic and anti-serotonin actions.5 Antihistamines can both stimulate and depress the central nervous system (CNS), but second-generation drugs do not appreciably cross the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, there are few reports of abnormal involuntary movements associated with antihistamines. However, Rajput et al. recently reported a pediatric case of dystonia induced by a second-generation antihistamine (cetirizine), possibly because of dopamine receptor blockade by the drug metabolite.6 Oxatomide can also cause dystonia.7 However, to our knowledge, there is only one report of antihistamine-induced myo-",0

"clonus, in that case caused by abusive overuse of a ﬁrst-generation antihistamine (tripelennamine).3 It remains unclear why oxatomide triggered myoclonus in our patient. We could not determine the plasma concentration of oxatomide when he was suffering from the myoclonus. However, cardiac or renal dysfunction might raise the drug concentration to a toxic level in the CNS, and the drug might affect the serotonergic system to cause myoclonus, although the serotonin hypothesis of myoclonus remains controversial.8 On the other hand, our patient was demented and being treated with antihypertensive agents. Dementia can lower the threshold for myoclonus or can be a cause of myoclonus in and of itself.1 Furthermore, cardiac medications can also cause myoclonus.1 Therefore, the minor toxic-metabolic disturbance caused by antihistamine use might have led our elderly, myoclonusprone patient into a transient myoclonic state. This is the ﬁrst report of myoclonus triggered by a therapeutic dose of antihistamines. Clinicians should recognize that antihistamines could trigger this benign but dramatic CNS side effect.",0

Do Parkinson’s Disease and Dementia with Lewy Bodies Differ by Route of Environmental Precipitant?,0
"Braak and colleagues followed their groundbreaking staging classiﬁcation for the brain neuropathology of Alzheimer’s disease with the more recent one for sporadic Parkinson’s disease (PD).1 Their new PD staging system has revolutionized thinking about the topographic sequence of neuropathological changes as the illness progresses, generally in a caudal-rostral direction from lower brainstem to neocortex.",0

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR	1617,0
"One of the most important of Braak et al.’s observations may be that olfactory structures are one of the ﬁrst sites of neuropathology in the central nervous system (CNS).2 Coupled with emerging evidence that characteristic synucleinopathic changes can be seen in the peripheral autonomic nervous system (including the gastrointestinal tract) even before CNS involvement,3–6 a critical implication of these ﬁndings is that the nose and mouth become suspect as portals of entry for an inciting pathogenic agent.",0
"After nasal entry, transneuronal transmission along olfactory pathways is a potential route to the brain. It has been shown, for example, that inhaled ultraﬁne heavy metal particles, which might come from occupational exposures, can pass through the nasal mucosa and be transynaptically transported to deeper brain regions.7 Once a pathogenic agent passes through the gastrointestinal mucosa after oral entry, the pathway via the enteric autonomic nervous system to the vagus nerve and the vagal nuclei in the lower brainstem (also one of the early loci of PD pathology in the CNS1,2) would be open. Thus, environmental factors in the air, water, and food look to be integrally involved in the initial phases of the illness. Potential environmental agents that have been suggested include agricultural pesticides and herbicides reviewed in,8,9 heavy metals,7 viruses,10 and prions.11 Genetic factors might inﬂuence individual susceptibility or response to the offending agents.",0
"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) differs from PD by diffuse synucleinopathic degeneration, involving cortex and brainstem, at onset rather than the initial focal olfactory and lower brainstem pathology of PD.12 It has been debated whether PD and DLB are variants of the same disease or represent distinct entities.13 Based on the differences in their neuropathologic temporal proﬁle, I hypothesize that there is an etiological difference that is primarily due to the route of exposure to inciting environmental agents. Under this view, PD results from respiratory (airborne) or gastrointestinal (water/foodborne) exposure while DLB develops following systemic (bloodborne) exposure. Type of toxicant and level of exposure might determine whether signiﬁcant concentrations are achieved in the circulation. Underlying genetic factors might also contribute to which route(s) and levels of exposure result in toxicity. The hypothesis is testable by comparing PD and DLB patients for routes, types, and magnitudes of environmental exposures.",0

Dystonia Associated with Hyperintense Basal Ganglia Lesions on T1-Weighted Brain MRI,0
"A 43-year-old man presented with cardiac arrest due to an anaphylactic shock after ﬂuorescein application for retinal angiography. After cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the patient could be weaned from tracheal respiration 2 days later. The initial neurological examination revealed generalized hypokinesia, rigidity of extremities, and severe axial dystonia with anterocollis and increased oromandibular tone with almost incapability to open the mouth (Fig. 1A). A mild reduction of hypokinesia occurred due to medication of amantadine and levodopa. The oromandibular dystonia improved considerably under repetitive local injections of botulinum toxin type A, and the patient is able to eat and speak without assistance. The clinical symptoms are stable since the initial attack over a period of 3.5 years now (see Fig. 1A and video for current clinical state).",0

"Together, the reasons for the initial T1-hyperintensities remain elusive.

Successful Treatment of the Meige Syndrome with Oral Zolpidem Monotherapy,0
"Zolpidem is an imidazopyridine agonist with a high afﬁnity for the benzodiazepine a1 subunit site.1 It has been reported that this drug improves motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson’s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and Xlinked dystonia-Parkinsonism syndrome.2–5 Recently, zolpidem has been shown to be effective in the treatment of blepharospasm and the Meige syndrome in combination with botulinum toxin A.6",0
"Here, we report a patient with Meige syndrome, nonresponsive to botulinum toxin A, but successfully treated with oral zolpidem administration.",0
"A 59-year-old man, previously healthy, presented with disabling blepharospasm, visual difﬁculty, and facial grimacing that began 6 months before presentation. Before four years, he reported an abnormal feeling of tension in the lower eyelid and subsequently developed involuntary excessive blinking. The dystonic symptoms were usually provoked by speaking or chewing. However, they continued at rest and were relieved by placing a pencil between his teeth. In addition, the patient reported that the symptoms were improved after taking oral zolpidem, prescribed for insomnia by his primary physician; he took this medication a half-hour before going to sleep. The patient had been treated with 50 mg quetiapine, 8 mg trihexiphenidyl, and 40 mg baclofen without any beneﬁt. In addition, botulinum toxin A treatment was attempted (Botox 40 units, injection in eight sites of the orbicularis oculi muscle and four sites of the orbicularis oris muscle), but this had little effect. The patient reported no history of head trauma, peripheral traumatic or surgical incidents, or neurological diseases. There was",0

no exposure to neuroleptic medications. There was no family history of movement disorders.,0
"The neurological examination was normal except for blepharospasm and oromandibular dystonia appearing synchronously. These movements were partially relieved by holding a pencil between the teeth (Segment 1). Neuropsychological testing for memory and frontal lobe functions was within normal limits. The evaluations including magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, electroencephalogram, serum chemistries, a complete blood count, serum ceruloplasmin, thyroid function tests, and genetic testing for the DYT1 mutation in the torsion A gene were normal. The dental and ophthalmology examinations were also normal.",0
"We evaluated whether oral zolpidem treatment could improve the blepharospasm and oromandibular dystonia. These symptoms completely resolved within 1 hour after taking this medicine, and the patient was symptom-free for 4 hours without somnolence (Segment 2). A long-acting zolpidem tartrate (12.5 mg four times per day) has been prescribed, and this patient remains symptom free during the daytime.",0
"Meige syndrome is a form of cranial dystonia; it affects the cranial muscles and is characterized by involuntary blinking and chin thrusting.7 This syndrome is considered a variant of idiopathic torsion dystonia. Although botulinum toxin injections are useful for the treatment of blepharospasm as well as facial and oromandibular dystonia, the symptoms are usually refractory or only partially relieved with this medication.8",0
"Zolpidem completely abolished the symptoms associated with the Meige syndrome in our patient without causing somnolence. The location of the highest density of zolpidembinding receptors is in the ventral globus pallidus, the substantia nigra pars reticulate, and the subthalamic nucleus.9,10 Recently, zolpidem in the subthalamic nucleus was shown to enhance g-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptormediated inhibitory synaptic currents and therefore appears to modulate motor behavior in awake animals11; these results suggested that zolpidem may inhibit the excitability of subthalamic neurons and therefore compensate for the excessive inhibition of basal ganglia targets in Parkinsonism, leading to the improvement of symptoms in Parkinson’s disease. However, because other basal ganglia nuclei also express zolpidem-binding sites, zolpidem may also exert electrophysiological effects on these other nuclei.12 In addition, other mechanisms may be involved in attenuating dyskinetic symptoms. For example, GABAergic drugs can be effective in ameliorating experimental orofaical dyskinesia by reinforcing the involvement GABAergic hypofunction,13 and the neuroprotective and antioxidant properties of zolpidem in vivo and in vitro may contribute to the modulation of dyskinesia.14",0
"Although the exact mechanism of binding to these sites is unknown, zolpidem might reverse the pathophysiological changes in the subthalamic nucleus, and therefore the whole basal ganglia circuit. In addition to the direct effects on the basal ganglia, we cannot rule out the possibility that the anxiolytic inﬂuence of zolpidem may contribute to its beneﬁcial effects on dystonia.",0
"In conclusion, oral zolpidem may be a useful pharmacologic alternative for patients with Meige syndrome who do not respond to botulinum toxin treatment. However, special precautions are necessary for long-term management with this drug because of the risk of zolpidem abuse, especially in patients with a previous history of substance abuse.15",0

Torsional Nystagmus Induced by Subthalamic Nucleus Stimulation,0
"Chronic bilateral stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is effective in severe Parkinson’s disease (PD).1 However, a few side effects, especially oculomotor manifestations have been reported.2 Understanding their mechanism may help to better deﬁne functional anatomy of this region.",0
"A 66-year-old woman was treated by bilateral STN stimulation for PD. A 40% decrease of the Uniﬁed Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor score followed STN stimulation alone with the following parameters: left, contact 2: 3.5 V/60 l second/160 Hz; right, contact 7: 3.5 V/90 l second/160 Hz.",0
"During parameters setting, she complained of vertigo, nauseas, and oscillopsia for high voltages of stimulation (‡3.5 V) on both sides, especially on contacts 1 (left) and 6 (right), at high intensity (respectively, 4.5 V and 3.5 V). We noticed a torsional nystagmus (TN) beating on the side opposite to the stimulation (the direction is given by the upper pole of the eye, relative to patient’s) (Table 1). This completely disappeared when the parameters of stimulation were decreased and was reproducible over time. End-of-surgery stereotactic coordinates of each contact were used to locate them within a 3D deformable atlas of the basal ganglia (see Fig. 1).3 This conﬁrmed the unusual medial trajectories of electrodes already suspected on the brain MRI.",0
"Under chronic stimulation parameters, we observed a right sided head tilt and a right skew deviation (i.e. hypotropic right eye). Eye motility was normal and there was no nystagmus. Subjective visual vertical (SVV) was tilted to the right (13.48), fundi disclosed bilateral right sided ocular torsion. This was consistent with a right sided ocular tilt reaction (OTR). Eye movement recording practiced after the patient gave her written consent, showed hypometric upward saccades, normal horizontal vestibulo ocular reﬂex (VOR), and smooth pursuit (Table 2).",0
"With right stimulation on contact 6 (3.5 V), a counterclockwise TN was found. Except for lower gain of VOR, eye movements were not modiﬁed (Table 2). Vertical saccades could not be correctly recorded. The skew deviation increased. SVV slightly decreased (12.048).",0
"With left stimulation on contact 1 (4.5 V), we noticed a clockwise TN. Velocities of downward saccades, downward smooth pursuit gain, and horizontal pendular VOR gain decreased (Table 2). The right sided skew deviation decreased, SVV normalized (10.48).",0
"Previously reported oculomotor side effects of STN stimulation consisted of eyelid apraxia, binocular diplopia, myosis, mydriasis, and contraversive eye deviation.1,2,4–14 TN has been observed during periaqueductal gray matter,15 but not during STN stimulation.",0
"STN is involved in saccades and smooth pursuit in primates and humans16–23 and its stimulation could explain some ocular motor side effects such as contraversive eye deviation.10 However, it is unlikely that STN could have induced the TN as it was not observed at low intensity of stimulation",0

"Two prenuclear midbrain structures adjacent to the STN could be implicated in the TN: the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fascicle (riMLF) and the interstitial nucleus of Cajal (iC). The riMLF is the immediate premotor structure for the generation of torsional and vertical saccades.25 On each side, riMLF would encode signals for both upward and downward, but only for ipsitorsional saccades.26 The iC is involved in the control of vertical and ipsilateral torsional VOR and velocity to position integrator.25 In human, lesions of riMLF alone or iC-combined essentially induce a contralesional TN with slowing of vertical saccades, contralesional torsional deviations during saccades and absent quick phases during ipsidirectional head rotations in roll.26–29 Unilateral iC lesion leads to ipsilesional TN and unilateral stimulation of the iC evokes ipsilateral eye torsion and head tilt in nonhuman.30,31 In humans, iC lesion sparing riMLF may induce ipsilesional TN28 and contraversive32,33 or ipsiversive28 ocular tilt reaction.",0
"Here, the dysfunction of vertical saccades is consistent with an inhibition of the riMLF but modulation of OTR can also suggest a stimulation of the iC. Whether this is explained by nucleus or afferent/efferent ﬁbers is not clear either. To clarify this point, it could be helpful to simulate the current density around the stimulation area.34",0
"According to the close relationship of iC, riMLF, and stimulation contacts, the contralateral TN reported here could be due to an activation of the iC or an inhibition of the riMLF or both, either due to a direct nucleus or an indirect in/out connecting pathways modulation.",0

Palatal Tremor and Facial Dyskinesia in a Patient with POLG1 Mutation,1
"Recently, a progressive ataxic syndrome (MSCAE) caused by zA467T and W748S POLG1 mutations was reported.1–4 The nuclear gene, POLG1 encodes the catalytic subunit of the mitochondrial DNA dependent polymerase, polymerase g5. The catalytic subunit comprises three domains, a polymerase and 30-50 exonuclease domain and an intervening linker region. Over 70 mutations have been reported in the catalytic subunit with both dominant and recessive modes of inheritance. The carrier frequency of these two mutations is high in Northern Europe, particularly Scandinavia.3 The clinical features associated with POLG1 mutation include progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO),6 Alpers’ syndrome,7 parkinsonism,8 or a syndrome with sensory ataxia, neuropathy, dysarthria, and ophthalmoplegia (SANDO).9 We present a young woman, homozygous for the W748S mutation and MSCAE that developed palatal tremor and facial dyskinesia and hypertrophic degeneration of the inferior olivary nuclei.",1
"The patient is now 35-years old without family history of epilepsy or movement disorder. She was ﬁrst seen at the age of 19 with focal epileptic seizures. Five years later external ophthalmoplegia and gait unsteadiness were noted and aged 28, during her ﬁrst pregnancy, she was admitted with focal epileptic seizures that were highly resistant to treatment. Two months later her symptoms worsened and included myoclonic jerks in the extremities and facial dyskinesias. Treatment with sodium valproate resulted in acute severe hepatic failure and she underwent a successful liver transplantation. Two years later a cerebral MRI scan showed marked hypertrophic degeneration of the inferior olives (Fig. 1). She denied symptoms of ear clicking.",1
"On examination at age 35, she had a mild cognitive deﬁcit, cerebellar dysarthria, mild external ophthalmoplegia, no nystagmus and no facial nerve dysfunction. She had an asymptomatic palatal tremor, consisting of soundless, bilateral, synchronous and symmetrical 2 Hz contractions of the soft palate plus facial dyskinesias consisting of continuous, rhythmic, undulating wave-like, bilateral periorbital movements.",1
"Intermittent, asymmetric limb myoclonus, cerebellar and sensory ataxia and signs of peripheral neuropathy with loss of reﬂexes and sensory disturbance were also present. Muscle bulk, tone, and power appeared normal. DNA analysis conﬁrmed that she was homozygous for the c. 2243G>C (p. W748S) mutation in POLG1.",1
"Our patient demonstrates the typical features of MSCAE with the combination of focal epilepsy, myoclonus and ataxia as well as sensitivity to sodium valproate.3,10 The interesting features are the rhythmical facial dyskinesia and the asymp-",1

tomatic palatal tremor with its structural correlate of inferior olivary nuclei involvement.,1
"Hypertrophic olivary degeneration (HOD) is clinically associated with palatal tremor and is often caused by pathology in the dentato-rubro-olivary pathways or also called Guillain-Mollaret triangle. Usually the lesion is caused by vascular ischemia, hemorrhage, infection, trauma, neoplasm or demyelination.11 A syndrome called progressive ataxia and palatal tremor (PAPT) has been reported and shows similarities to our case. Even though sporadic PAPT cases had a heterogeneous clinical picture, the cerebellar degeneration was the most symptomatic feature and HOD was common in the presented cases.12 In the familiar forms of PAPT, however, olivary pathology was absent. Palatal tremor with olivary hypertrophy and dentate calciﬁcation has also been described in a form of spinocerebellar ataxia, SCA 20.13",1
In our patient HOD was an incidental MRI ﬁnding without any obvious clinical symptoms. It occurred several years after disease onset. The lack of ear clicks or other symptoms may explain why this clinical picture has not been reported by other authors. Asymptomatic palatal tremor may also be easily overlooked in a routine clinical examination.,1
"Facial dyskinesia appeared as wave-like periorbital involuntary movements on both sides, but not perioral. These asymmetric movements, alternating from one side to the other were most prominent when she was in a resting position. She had never been treated with neuroleptic or antiparkinsonian drugs that might have induced this feature. EEG recorded routinely due to her epilepsy has not shown any correlate with these movements. Orofacial dyskinesia is reported in chorea acanthocytosis together with other symptoms like dysphagia, dysarthria, areﬂexia, seizures, and dementia.14 Facial myorhythmia is also pathognomic for Whipple’s disease mostly localized around the eyes and jaw. Other symptoms as seizures, myoclonus, ophthalmoplegia, and dysarthria are also common. A diagnostic criterion for this entity is small intestine biopsy that excluded the disease.",1
"We present a case with the typical clinical features of POLG1 mutation and additional novel ﬁndings of palatal tremor with HOD on MRI and facial dyskinesia. These ﬁndings expand the clinical spectrum of the syndromes caused by mutation in this gene. Moreover, since palatal tremor is a rare disorder, and often reported as a sporadic entity, we suggest that POLG1 mutation should be considered in patients with this disorder.",1
"Segment 1. The patient shows gait ataxia and mild external ophthalmoplegia. She has bilateral, asymmetrical rhythmical facial dyskinesias, mainly in the periorbital regions. The asymptomatic palatal tremor: soundless, bilateral, synchronous and symmetrical 2Hz contractions of the soft palate.",1

Thalamic Stimulation Does Not Involve a High Rate of Suicide,0
"I read with some concern the paper of Appleby et al. published in the September issue of MDJ.1 The authors write in the abstract, ‘‘Reported rates of depression, cognitive impairment, mania, and behavior change are low, but there is a high rate of suicide in patients treated with DBS, particularly with thalamic and GPi stimulation.’’ In the Results section, the authors provide numbers and percentage of ‘‘those patients that expressed suicidality (deﬁned as suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, or completed suicide).’’ They wrote, ‘‘Most patients underwent DBS for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease (26; 81%); 4 had dystonia (12.5%), 1 had essential tremor (3%), and another had OCD (3%).’’ Then the authors provide details of the brain target for DBS in these patients: ‘‘26 patients (81%) were implanted in the STN, 4 (12.5%) had GPi implants, and 1 (3%) had a VIM implant, and the last patient received an anterior limb of the internal capsule implant.’’ Then, toward the end of the Results section, they wrote, ‘‘The rate of completed suicide was highest in the thalamus group (5.4%).’’",0
"In my reading, these results simply do not add up and the drawn conclusions expressed both in the abstract and in the discussion of that paper do not substantiate, in fact contradict, the ﬁgures and percentage cited. This article is supposed to be a review of the literature and a meta-analysis, but nowhere can one read how the meta-analysis was statistically conducted. To start with, there is no information about the number of patients with the various diagnoses or the number of patients operated on in the various brain targets. There is instead information about number of publications, their geographical origin, gender of patients, etc. There is no mention of any data providing the percentage of patients with suicidality in relation to the number of patients operated on, in any of the brain targets, or for any of the diagnoses.",0
"In the quoted references, I cannot ﬁnd any reference that supports the authors’ claim that thalamic stimulation carries the highest risk for suicidality, and the authors do not give the citation reference numbers to back up their conclusions. To name but one example, the last patient who committed suicide and who ‘‘received an anterior limb of the internal capsule implant’’ is certainly the patient described by Abelson et al. in the (nonquoted) paper on four patients with OCD treated with DBS.2",0
"The authors wrote, ‘‘Since its approval by the FDA in 1997 for use in Parkinson’s disease, DBS has been used to treat essential tremor, dystonia, cluster headaches, and chronic pain1–4’’ and among these 4 quoted references, one (Ref. 4) was actually about DBS for epilepsy. Besides, it is",0
"true that FDA granted approval for thalamic DBS for parkinsonian and essential tremor in 1997, then pallidal DBS and STN DBS for advanced PD in 2001. However, for dystonia, the FDA granted in 2003 a humanitarian device exemption, which is not a full approval.",0
"Instead of providing several tables detailing device-related adverse events (Table 3) and somatic adverse events (table 4), both of which are evidently out of the scope of this paper on psychiatric and neuropsychiatric adverse events, it would have been more helpful to provide tables of the percentage or prevalence of suicides according to target and diagnosis. In my review of the literature, suicidality following DBS is overall rare, and its prevalence is higher in patients with subthalamic DBS compared to thalamic DBS, a ﬁnding contrary to their statement (in the abstract and on page 1726).",0
"The ﬁnal conclusion of this article reads, ‘‘Our ﬁndings are optimistic regarding the use of DBS for psychiatric disorders.’’ Which ﬁndings? I looked repeatedly in the paper for any results, ﬁgures, or tables that would justify such a conclusion but could ﬁnd none. In the context of this study, such a conclusion seems to me in need of reconsideration, and the data need to be clearly provided.",0
"In my view, we are left with a published study that could potentially have been an extremely informative analysis had the authors separated thalamus and subthalamus and had they carefully evaluated the literature that they set themselves to review. The meta-analysis promised in the title of this work was not provided, and the authors fall short of answering the issues at stake.",0

"patient with dystonia developing MG may, therefore, show improvement of dystonic symptoms. Here, we present 2 patients with coexisting dystonia and MG.",0
"A 69-year-old woman, 19 years earlier, noticed intermittent turning of her head to the right side which had begun suddenly following a motor vehicle accident. She had sideto-side movement of her head with rotation and tilt to the right side. It was aggravated by stress and suppressed with sensory tricks. There was no family history of dystonia or of prior treatment with neuroleptic medications. She was diagnosed with cervical dystonia with mild head tremor. She tried various oral medications with no improvement. She was never treated with botulinum toxin.",0
"Seven years ago, she developed double vision, drooping of the eyelids, and generalized weakness. She also noted marked reduction of dystonic movements at the same time. Neurological examination revealed bilateral ptosis and diplopia, which worsened on fatigue. She had minimal dystonic head tremor, with torticollis to the right of 208 and right laterocollis of 158. She also had bilateral orbicularis oculi and generalized proximal muscle weakness. The remainder of her neurological examination disclosed no abnormalities. She was diagnosed with generalized seropositive myasthenia gravis and started on pyridostigmine and corticosteroids, which resulted in the improvement of the myasthenic symptoms and signs. On recent follow up, she had minimal head tremor in the side-to-side direction, mild residual weakness of the cervical muscles, and no relapse of cervical dystonia.",0
"A 61-year-old man with cerebral palsy developed blepharospasm several years prior to presentation to our facility. One year earlier, he received botulinum toxin treatment which provided temporary improvement of this disorder. About 6 months before evaluation, he complained of progressive bilateral lower extremity weakness and dysphagia to both solids and liquids. Neurological examination revealed bilateral ptosis, ophthalmoparesis, and mild generalized proximal muscle weakness. His blepharospasm disappeared and none was observed during the examination. Following further investigations including neurophysiological testing (which showed a signiﬁcant decremental response on repetitive nerve stimulation at 3 Hz), he was diagnosed with seropositive generalized myasthenia gravis. He was treated with pyridostigmine, corticosteroids, and azathioprine. A follow-up examination 2 years later showed marked improvement of myasthenic symptoms but with mild residual weakness of the orbicularis oculi. He had no recurrence of blepharospasm.",0
"Approximately 33% of patients diagnosed with focal or segmental dystonia and treated with anticholinergic drugs show a modest improvement in symptoms compared with signiﬁcant improvement in 90% treated with local intramuscular botulinum toxin.1 Botulinum toxin binds at the neuromuscular junction and prevents the release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic terminal. It results in temporary weakness of the skeletal muscles into which it is injected, which can ameliorate the symptoms and signs of dystonia. The median duration of",0
"effect is about 12.5 weeks.2 It is the treatment of choice for cervical dystonia, blepharospasm, spasmodic dysphonia, oromandibular dystonia, and limb dystonia.3",0
"Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder caused by autoantibodies against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor on the postsynaptic membrane at the neuromuscular junction.4 Both our patients had acetylcholine receptor antibody positive generalized myasthenia gravis and both had improvement of their movement disorders. There was marked improvement of torticollis in our ﬁrst patient and resolution of blepharospasm in the second after the development of generalized myasthenia gravis. A review of the literature reveals two reports of patients who had both generalized myasthenia gravis and dystonia. Interestingly, in contrast to our patients, both of them developed only temporary improvement of the dystonia.5,6 Furthermore, in one of these patients, the recurrent dystonia was successfully treated with botulinum toxin.6 It is possible that our patients did not develop a recurrence of dystonia due to mild residual muscle weakness secondary to the myasthenia gravis.",0
Clinical improvement of dystonia after the onset of MG attests to an intriguing relationship between dystonia and MG serving as another example of an experiment of nature. Spontaneous improvement of symptoms in a dystonic patient should direct attention to the possibility of developing a NMJ disorder.,0

"We report a case of an adult-onset, mutation proven Alexander disease characterized by cerebellar and sensory ataxia, the absence of palatal tremor, and very mild white matter changes.1,2 This 61-year-old man presented at the age of 50 years with slowly progressive gait difﬁculties. His past medical history revealed the onset of static but marked forward ﬂexion of the trunk in his ﬁrst decade, but without any motor abnormalities until recently. His sister had been diagnosed with progressive cerebellar ataxia; there were no other affected relatives.",0
"We screened for several of the genetic ataxias, but no mutations were detected in the SCA1/2/3/6/7/14 genes or in the genes responsible for Friedreich’s ataxia and dentatorubro-pallido-luysian atrophy. Electromyography showed no signs of neuropathy or myopathy. SSEP was not performed. MRI demonstrated subtle white matter lesions anteriorly in both temporal lobes, as well as mild atrophy of the cerebellum, brainstem and cervical spinal cord on standard MRI imaging (Fig. 1A–C). Additional Supporting Information may be found in the online version of this article.",0
"As these combined clinical and imaging features were suggestive of Alexander disease, we sequenced the GFAP gene, and found a novel heterozygous c.692T > A missense mutation in exon 4, predicting a p.Leu231His amino acid change; this mutation was not encountered in 210 control chromosomes. Several cases of adult-onset Alexander disease have been reported, mostly with an onset in the third or fourth decade of life. Phenotypic heterogeneity is evident from the variable presence of bulbar symptoms, cerebellar signs, palatal tremor, spastic paresis, and autonomic dysfunction.",0

"Chronic bilateral stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is effective in severe Parkinson’s disease (PD).1 However, a few side effects, especially oculomotor manifestations have been reported.2 Understanding their mechanism may help to better deﬁne functional anatomy of this region. A 66-year-old woman was treated by bilateral STN stimulation for PD. A 40% decrease of the Uniﬁed Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor score followed STN stimulation alone with the following parameters: left, contact 2: 3.5 V/60 l second/160 Hz; right, contact 7: 3.5 V/90 l second/160 Hz.",0
"With right stimulation on contact 6 (3.5 V), a counterclockwise TN was found. Except for lower gain of VOR, eye movements were not modiﬁed (Table 2). Vertical saccades could not be correctly recorded. The skew deviation increased. SVV slightly decreased (12.048). With left stimulation on contact 1 (4.5 V), we noticed a clockwise TN. Velocities of downward saccades, downward smooth pursuit gain, and horizontal pendular VOR gain decreased (Table 2). The right sided skew deviation decreased, SVV normalized (10.48).",0
"Previously reported oculomotor side effects of STN stimulation consisted of eyelid apraxia, binocular diplopia, myosis, mydriasis, and contraversive eye deviation.1,2,4–14 TN has been observed during periaqueductal gray matter,15 but not during STN stimulation. STN is involved in saccades and smooth pursuit in primates and humans16–23 and its stimulation could explain some ocular motor side effects such as contraversive eye deviation.10 However, it is unlikely that STN could have induced the TN as it was not observed at low intensity of stimulation",0

"Mutations in the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) accumulate in a variety of tissues with age [1]. It has been proposed that these somatic mtDNA mutations play a role in ageing and age-related diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) [2,3]. Recently, it was shown that high levels of deleted mtDNA are present in substantia nigra (SN) neurones from both aged controls and individuals with PD, strengthening the suggestion that somatic mtDNA deletions are involved in the selective neuronal loss observed in brain ageing and in PD [2,4]. To further investigate a possible association between multiple mtDNA deletions and ageing, we performed post mortem examination of the brain from a patient with multiple mtDNA deletions. Multiple mtDNA deletions usually develop secondary to a mutation in one of the enzymes involved in mtDNA maintenance, e.g. polymerase gamma, encoded by the nuclear gene POLG1 [5]. Patients with multiple mtDNA deletions show clinical heterogeneity [6], although in our patient chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) and Parkinsonism were both prominent features.",0
The patient first presented at the age of 22 years with,1
"left-sided ptosis, which slowly progressed over the next 20 years to an almost complete ophthalmoplegia. He developed proximal muscle weakness at age 50 and his first Parkinsonian features at age 51. The features, including rigidity, tremor, bradykinesia and difficulty performing fine motor tasks, were initially unilateral and responded well to dopamine agonists. Aged 54 years, he showed signs of cognitive impairment and increasing dysphagia, dysarthria and dysphonia. His proximal myopathy also became more prominent and there was evidence of sensorimotor neuropathy at age 57. Dopamine agonists became less effective, but he responded well to apomorphine. His dysphagia deteriorated and a PEG tube was inserted because of recurrent aspiration. The patient died aged 59 years because of pneumonia. There was no family history of either mitochondrial disease or PD.",1
"Examination of a post mortem skeletal muscle sample revealed features of mitochondrial myopathy with frequent muscle fibres deficient in the mtDNA-encoded cytochrome c oxidase (COX), some of which were hyperactive for nuclear DNA (nDNA) encoded succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) (Figure 1A). Multiple mtDNA deletions were detected, bothon Southernblot andlong-range PCR assays of total muscle homogenate DNA (Figure 1B). Genetic analysis revealed that the patient was compound heterozygous for mutations in the nDNA-encoded POLG1 gene, coding for thecatalytic subunitof themtDNA-specific polymerase g [7]. These compound heterozygous mutations were c.3311CG (p.S1104C) and c.2542GA (p.G848S).",1
"Macroscopic examination of the brain did not reveal any external abnormalities; however, the SN was almost devoid of pigment throughout. Microscopic examination of the midbrain revealed the extent of SN neuronal loss, which was severe in the lateral group, moderately severe in the middle group and moderately severe in the medial group of the lower midbrain and also uniformly moderate to moderately severe in the upper midbrain. With haematoxylin and eosin stain Lewy bodies (LBs) were seen in the surviving SN neurones (Figure 2A). The red, oculomotor, Edinger-Westphal and dorsal raphe nuclei appeared unaffected. Within the pons there was mild loss of neurones in the locus coeruleus and normal neuronal population density (n.p.d.) within the superior raphe. Within the medulla the n.p.d. of the dorsal nucleus of vagus and of the olivary nuclei were relatively intact. The cerebellum was affected with moderate focal loss of Purkinje cells and focal mild neurone loss in the dentate nucleus. In the basal forebrain the n.p.d. of the nucleus of Meynert appeared intact. Immunohistochemistry using antibodies to alphasynuclein revealed a high proportion of neurones with cytoplasmic immunoreactivity, neurites and immunoreactivity in the neuropil of the SN (Figure 2B) and the nucleus of Meynert. The dorsal nucleus of vagus and the other brainstem and subcortical nuclei showed only mild LB pathology. Fewer than five alpha-synucleinimmunoreactive LBs were present in the anterior cingulate and the frontal cortex but none in the transentorhinal, lateral temporal or parietal cortex. This",1

"Dual COX/SDH histochemistry revealed that 21.2% of the remaining SN neurones were COX-deficient (Figure 2D). This level of COX deficiency is higher than the levels recently observed in the SN of ageing controls (1%) and PD patients (3%) [2]. Immunohistochemistry for the mtDNA-encoded COX subunit I revealed deficiency in individual nigral neurones (Figure 2E), while all nigral neurones showed normal activity for porin, a transmembrane mitochondrial protein used as a reference marker for mitochondrial mass (Figure 2F). From the remaining SN neurones, five pooled, single neurones were laser-microdissected and mtDNA deletion load was assessed using a previously multiplex real-time PCR [9]. The results confirmed high levels of mtDNA deletions in the SN neurones (~65%, n = 5).",1
"Parkinsonism has been previously described in PEO patients with mtDNA deletions [5], as has severe neuronal loss from the SN in patients with multiple mtDNA deletion disorders [10,11].

"Results. Sequence analysis identified two previously undescribed mutations (1868T>G and 2263A>G) located in the gene coding the catalytic subunit of mitochondrial DNA polymerase 'Y (POLG), predicting an L623W and K755E amino acid change, respectively. Both mutations were located in the highly conserved linker region of the protein and were absent in more than 200 healthy unrelated control subjects. The identification of these two mutations allowed us to perform genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis.",1

"copy number. MDS is phenotypically heterogeneous, manifesting either as a hepatocerebral, encephalomyopathic or myopathic form [1]. All these syndromes result from defects in nucleus-encoded factors and are mostly inherited as autosomal recessive traits [2]. The hepatocerebral form is probably the most common variant of MDS, characterized by an infantile onset of acute liver failure and associated with lethargy, hypotonia, vomiting, seizures and hypoglycaemia [3,4]. Three genes have been identified as major cause of this MDS form: DGUOK [5,6], which encodes the deoxyguano-",0

POLG1 is a major disease gene in mitochondrial disorders [11]. Mutations in this gene can be associated with depletion but also with multiple deletions or point mutations of mitochondrial DNA [12]. This genetic complexity is associated with an extremely heterogeneous clinical presentation, with an overlapping phenotypic spectrum ranging from severe and fatal childhood hepatoencephalopathy to late-onset external ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, myopathy and epilepsy [4,13,14].",0

"An 18-month-old boy – the second child to healthy unrelated parents – was referred for a history of hypoketotic hypoglycaemia. He was born at term and his history was unremarkable until 18 months of age, when he was admitted for the first time to the local hospital due to an episode of lethargy which happened late in the morning. The child had not had any breakfast. Glycaemia was 19 mg/dl with a mild ketonuria (1 + at a Combur test urine stix).",1
"Laboratory tests showed raised levels of transaminase, alterations of coagulation and metabolic acidosis (see Table 1). Serological testing for parvovirus, hepatitis B, C, A, cytomegalovirus and Ebstein-Barr virus was negative. He recovered in a few days, clinical conditions were apparently normal so he was discharged with a program of further tests and follow-up. Fundamental developmental milestones appeared normally acquired, even though a Brunette-Lezine test showed a psychomotor delay (QS 79).",1

"The analysis performed on cDNA (4465 bp) – and confirmed on genomic DNA – demonstrated that the patient was a compound heterozygote for a (maternal) 1868T>G mutation (exon 10 of the POLG1 gene) predicting an L623W amino acid change, and a (paternal) 2263A>G mutation (exon 13 of the POLG1 gene) predicting a K755E amino acid change (Fig. 2A). Both mutations had never been previously reported and were absent in more than 200 healthy unrelated control subjects. L623W and K755E amino acid changes are located in the ‘linker’ region (spacer) between the N-terminal proofreading domain and the C-terminal polymerase domain of the protein (Fig. 3).",1
"Moreover, interspecies comparison demonstrates that L623 and K755 residues are highly conserved in vertebrates and in Drosophila Melanogaster (Fig. 2B). After one year, the mother reported being pregnant of another baby and a prenatal diagnostic procedure, starting from nuclear DNA isolated from amniotic fluid cells, was carried out. The new foetus tested heterozygote for the maternal mutation while the paternal allele was normal. He was delivered uneventfully and is now a healthy baby of 16 months of age (Fig. 4). Fig. 4. Pedigree of family harbouring the newly identified mutations.",0
"Discussion Mitochondrial disorders are often associated with liver dysfunction because of the high mitochondrial density in hepatocyte and the need for high levels of ATP for its biosynthetic and detoxifying functions. In this article, we describe a patient affected by liver mitochondrial DNA depletion with recurrent hypoketotic hypoglycaemia and fatal liver failure. The level of depletion is consistent with that observed in some patients showing a severe neonatal-onset liver involvement (liver insufficiency or hepatocellular dysfunction), as described by other authors [22].",0
"While it is well known that hypoketotic hypoglycaemia is a common symptom of beta oxidation deficit, few cases have been reported of mithocondrial DNA depletion with isolated liver disease—i.e. without evident muscle or CNS involvement, with a relatively late onset and without lactic acidosis [23–25,10]. As a matter of fact, some cases of Alper’s syndrome with POLG mutations have already been published, but only few of them emphasize the possibility of a late onset (after one year of age) isolated liver disease. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, none of these cases presented normal lactic acid levels, as in our patient.",0
"The molecular genetic analysis identified two previously undescribed mutations located in the gene encoding the catalytic subunit (a subunit) of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase 'Y (POLG). These mutations are assumed to be pathogenic because they are not reported as polymorphic changes, are absent from more than 400 control alleles and can change highly conserved amino acids. The leucine residue at codon 623 is located in a highly conserved region in vertebrates (Fig. 2B) and includes another pathogenic POLG1 mutation, namely R627W [26]. The region containing the lysine residue at codon 755 is also conserved in drosophila (Fig. 2B) and includes the pathogenic F749S POLG1 mutation [27].",0
"DNA polymerase 'Y is composed of 2 subunits (a and �) and is necessary for replication and repair of the mtDNA, presenting both DNA polymerase and 3∗–5∗ exonuclease activity [28]. The region of POLG-a located between the exonuclease and polymerase (“spacer”) has four POLG-a specific sequences ('Y1–'Y4) (Fig. 3) [29] which are highly conserved in species from drosophila to human. The two mutations identified in our patient lead to the amino acids substitutions in the 'Y3 (L623W) and 'Y4 (K755E) region of the POLG-a spacer (Fig. 3).",1
"Up to date – although the almost 30 disease mutations located in the spacer region of the POLG gene [30] have been associated with the most severe clinical manifestations – most of them have not been biochemically characterized yet or linked to a specific phenotype [29]. However, mutagenesis in these conserved blocks ('Y3 and 'Y4) in drosophila protein seems to induce low DNA polymerase activity ('Y3 and 'Y4) and decrease of interaction with POLG-� subunit ('Y4) [31]. The strongest hypothesis during the initial diagnostic work up was that of a possible medium chain Acyl-CoA deficiency (MCAD). The clinical and laboratory picture of MCAD can initially resemble a mitochondrial DNA depletion and MCAD is by far more frequent than mitochondrial DNA depletion. Furthermore, normal lactate levels made unlikely the hypothesis of a mitochondrial DNA depletion. While waiting for the results of the Acyl-CoA tests, the child was put on continuous enteral feeding to avoid hypoglycaemia and further crises. Despite this, he developed severe episodes of hypoglycaemia and liver abnormalities. We believe that in this setting the recurrence of hypoglycaemia without fasting should have strongly induced the suspicion of a mitochondrial DNA depletion. This case is a further warning of the fact that even if this is a rare event it should be taken into account in differential diagnoses. A strong clinical suspicion could have accelerated diagnostic testing, particularly in the perspective of a possible emergency liver transplant. The issue of liver transplant in mitochondrial DNA depletion has been debated without a definite consensus [24,25,10]. The possibility of a multivisceral involvement (muscle, brain, heart) in the forthcoming years is an argument against transplant. In our case, the protracted lethargy accompanying the critical episodes could suggest possible future brain involvement",0
"[4]. Moreover, we retain that this case is relevant also because it adds to the knowledge of two new mutations never reported before in literature, allowing us to perform genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis.",0
"To our knowledge, only two authors have reported prenatal findings that were later confirmed as MDS [22,29]. In the first case, prenatal diagnosis was based on immunocytochemical staining of an mtDNA encoded protein from cultured amniocytes and confirmed by the measurement of mtDNA in liver and muscle after birth [32]. However, as measuring mtDNA levels from amniocytes or from chorionic villus is currently not a standard procedure, this approach cannot be considered a valid option for prenatal diagnosis. More recently prenatal",0
"diagnosis starting from nuclear DNA isolated from amniotic fluid has been reported in a family at risk for MDS due to DGK gene mutations [13]. In our case, the identification of defined genetic mutations in the POLG gene allowed us to perform accurate prenatal testing by analyzing amniocytes’ nuclear DNA by PCR and direct sequencing.",0
"As a conclusion, our data further expand the spectrum of POLG1 gene mutations and the unique phenotype reported increase the variability of clinical presentations associated with mutations in this gene. Since an accurate molecular diagnosis is essential for proper genetic counselling and prenatal diagnostics, we suggest performing POLG1 mutation analysis in children with a variety of clinical aspects of mitochondrial disorders, including those showing late onset isolated liver disease without lactic acidosis.

In 1 study, end-state hepatic disease developed in only 2 of 26 cases (2). In another study, the only patients who experienced hepatic disease had been exposed to sodium valproate (3,4).

In each case, the second relapse was severe and disabling, occurring within months of onset. In each patient, serum NMO-IgG testing was negative at a 1:120 dilution and simultaneous CSF NMO-IgG was positive during an exacerbation, before administration of corticosteroids. Antibody testing was performed by the same laboratory (Mayo Medical Laboratories). The cause of NMO-IgG seronegativity in these three CSFpositive patients is unknown. The presence of a coexisting, interfering antibody may hinder serologic interpretation. However, only case 3 was noted to have coexisting ANA.

"Serum testing for NMO-IgG remains the standard test for confirming a diagnosis of relapsing NMO spectrum disorder. In our three seronegative cases of relapsing LETM, detection of NMOIgG in the CSF confirmed the diagnosis of an NMO spectrum disorder, and mandated initiation of immunosuppressive therapies. The potential value of early treatment emphasizes the importance of making the correct diagnosis.7 If NMO is strongly suspected and serum NMO-IgG is negative, measurement of CSF NMO-IgG is recommended and may add to the overall sensitivity of laboratory testing. Clinical scenarios that may warrant supplementary testing of CSF include the following: 1) LETM, 2) relapsing TM, 3) severe and bilateral ON, 4) ON with poor recovery, and",0
"5) rapidly relapsing ON. CSF studies should not be a substitute for serum testing.

"Combined morphological, immunocytochemical, biochemical and molecular genetic studies were performed on skeletal muscle, heart muscle and liver tissue of a 16-months boy with fatal liver failure. The pathological characterization of the tissues revealed a severe depletion of mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA) that was most pronounced in liver, followed by a less severe, but still significant depletion in skeletal muscle and the heart. The primary cause of the disease was linked to compound heterozygous mutations in the polymerase 'Y (POLG) gene (DNA polymerase 'Y; A467T, K1191N). We present evidence, that compound heterozygous POLG mutations lead to tissue selective impairment of mtDNA replication and thus to a mosaic defect pattern even in the severely affected liver. A variable defect pattern was found in liver, muscle and heart tissue as revealed by biochemical, cytochemical, immunocytochemical and in situ hybridization analysis. Functionally, a severe deficiency of cytochrome-c-oxidase (cox) activity was seen in the liver. Although mtDNA depletion was detected in heart and skeletal muscle, there was no cox deficiency in these tissues. Depletion of mtDNA and microdissection of coxpositive or negative areas correlated with the histological pattern in the liver. Interestingly, the mosaic pattern detected for cox-activity and mtDNA copy number fully aligned with the immunohistologically revealed defect pattern using Pol 'Y, mtSSBand mtTFA-antibodies, thus substantiating the hypothesis that nuclear encoded proteins located within mitochondria become unstable and are degraded when they are not actively bound to mtDNA. Their disappearance could also aggravate the mtDNA depletion and contribute to the nonhomogenous defect pattern.",1

The disorders involve mostly skeletal muscle and brain, but other organs may also be affected. In this context, liver failure due to depletion of mtDNA is relatively common [6–11]. Depletion of mtDNA may be caused by mutations in different genes. Mutations in the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of polymerase 'Y [12–14] are associated with depletion of mtDNA and subsequently liver failure and have been described most often in Alpers-Huttenlocher disease [15–19]. However, these mutations were also found in a wide spectrum of other clinical disorders, including autosomally inherited progressive external ophthalmoplegia, sensory-neural neuropathy, ataxia, epilepsy and parkinsonism [20, 21]. Therefore, an interesting question is how other coexisting metabolic alterations might influence the",0

"In this study, we describe the morphological, cyto-immunocytochemical, biochemical and molecular genetic results in a 16-months old child, who died of liver failure due to mutations in the polymerase 'Y (POLG) gene. Our study showed heterogenic tissue involvement with a mosaic defect pattern in the liver probably related to concomitant secondary dysfunction of further proteins involved in mtDNA maintenance like mitochondrial single stranded binding protein (mtSSB) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (mtTFA). The results help to explain the occasionally observed recovery from mtDNA depletion and indicate also that a slight increase in the mtDNA copy number might be enough to retain the normal respiratory function, which may open possibilities for therapeutic trials in the future.",1

The other mutation (K1191N) affects a highly conserved amino acid in the polymerase domain in trans with the A467T mutation [20]. Both parents harboured one of the two mutations found in the child proving compound heterozygosity. Discussion",1
"Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting either selectively or in combinations various organs, especially the liver, heart, kidneys, skeletal muscle and brain. In contrast to other mitochondrial diseases, severe depletion of mtDNA often affects the liver and can lead to liver failure. [6–11]. Depletion of mtDNA in the liver has also been found in oncocytic hepatocytes [35], associated with defects of the respiratory chain [25] most probably as an effect of cellular ageing [31].",0
"The enzyme responsible for mtDNA replication is Pol 'Y, which consists of a 140 kD catalytic polypeptide (encoded by POLG or POLG1) and two identical 55 kD accessory subunits (encoded by POLG2) that are required for an increased DNA affinity and highly processive DNA synthesis [12, 14, 36, 37]. The majority of mutations involved with Pol 'Y have been genetically linked to the POLG gene [15–19] while mutations in POLG2 are rare [38].",0
"Over 150 disease causing mutations have been reported in POLG where the A467T mutation of POLG has been observed to be the most frequent [12, 20, 21] (see also http://tools.niehs.nih.gov/polg/). The A467T mutation compromises the interaction with the accessory subunit and decreases polymerase activity [12]. Patients heterozygous for the A467T mutation, like the patient described here, are usually more severely affected than A467T homozygotes [20, 39]. Patients with compound heterozygous mutations involving A467T display a wide clinical phenotype from PEO to Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome, but, in general, mutations in the polymerase domain, such as the K1191N, are associated with Alpers syndrome [40]. The fatal liver failure in our patient was comparable with the liver fail-",0
"ure seen in Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome; however, the lack of epilepsy makes the clinical presentation atypical. Although clinically silent the child also had mitochondrial cardiomyopathy. Thus, our studies provide evidence that the heart muscle might also be affected by mutations in POLG.",1
"Furthermore, our study confirms the occurrence of tissue dependent defects [19, 41–44]. Whereas only a mild mitochondrial cytopathy of the heart and skeletal muscle was seen on single cells/ fibre level a severe but nevertheless non-homogenous defect was detected in the liver. The finding of non-homogenous liver involvement has been previously reported in three studies [10, 11, 63]. The underlying pathogenic mechanisms were, however, not further elucidated. In the present study, we analyzed the defect pattern by cytochemical and immunocytochemical detection of cytochrome-coxidase and for the first time combined the findings with in situ hybridization of mtDNA and additional quantitative PCR analysis of mtDNA on isolated cox-positive and cox-negative liver cells.",0
"In whole liver preparations the mtDNA copy number proved to be 80% reduced (referred to the lowest normal value). In isolated cox-positive liver cells mtDNA was similarly depleted. Cox-negative liver cells, however, exhibited an even more severe depletion. Their mtDNA content was about 9 times lower than that of",0
"cox-positive liver cells. This quantitative analysis correlated well with the results obtained by in situ hybridization of mtDNA. Interestingly, no defect could be localized in the biliary duct cell system. Thus, our findings suggest that even when mtDNA is depleted in liver, the amount of depletion has to reach a critical threshold in single cells in order to express the biochemical defect and this may be variable within single cells. Thereby, similar to the skeletal muscle [45, 46] a mosaic defect pattern may result [63]. In the skeletal muscle 0.01 mtDNA/µm3 has been found sufficient for residual cytochrome c oxidase activity [46]. Therefore, a slight increase in the mtDNA copy number might be enough to traverse the threshold value to regain the normal respiratory function. This observation may open new possibilities for further therapy trials and may explain the occasionally observed reversibility of mtDNA depletion [47–49]. The mechanisms, however, underlying the expression of tissue selectivity and the reversibility remain still unclear [50, 51].",0
"Besides tissue specific isoforms of enzymes enrolled in DNA replication and maintenance, oxidative damage from free radicals might be a causative factor since Pol 'Y is susceptible to oxidative damage in vitro [52, 53]. In the present case, the compound heterozygous mutations in POLG presented as immunohistochemically J. Cell. Mol. Med. Vol 15, No 2, 2011 severely reduced Pol 'Y protein and a mosaic pattern of cox-staining and mtDNA levels. In a previous case, with DNA depletion caused by a homozygous deoxyguanosine kinase gene (DGUOK) mutation",0
[54] expression of Pol 'Y was shown to be normal [11].,0
"In our study, we also tested the expression of mitochondrial transcription factor (mtTFA) and of mitochondrial single stranded protein (mtSSB), which both are involved in mtDNA-replication. H-mtTFA is a 25 kD protein, indispensable for transcription and replication of mtDNA [55]. The protein bends and unwinds mtDNA, thus priming transcription and replication [5, 56]. In the liver of the present patient a mosaic defect pattern of both proteins existed. In a previously described case [11] with a hepatic form of mtDNA depletion caused by a homozygous DGUOK gene mutation",0
"[54] mtTFA and mtSSB were also defective, the latter, however only in single abnormal hepatocytes. In a previous study on parathyroids with defects of cytochrome-c-oxidase both mtTFA and polymerase 'Y were regularly expressed [57]. It is generally accepted that h-mtTFA mirrors the mtDNA status of the cell, but it is most likely that reduction of h-mtTFA represents a secondary phenomenon as it is also reduced in cell lines where mtDNA copy number was experimentally reduced [58, 59]. Therefore, it appears that similar as in Saccharomyces cerevisiae",0
"[60] in the liver mitochondrial proteins are soon degraded when they are not properly assembled, e.g. because of reduced binding sites. A similar observation concerns the single strand binding protein (mtSSB). As mtSSB is essential for mtDNA replication and thus the maintenance of the DNA, its amount directly correlates with the mtDNA content [61]. Consequently, it may be assumed that the reduced appearance of mtTFA and mtSSB mirrors the replicative failure of mtDNA. It therefore appears that depletion",0
"represents a dynamic process leading to additional secondary alterations in the mtDNA replicative machinery which might also aggravate the degree of mtDNA depletion and be a contributory cause of the mosaic defect pattern in the liver. We also addressed the question of comorbitity with other chronic liver diseases [22]. But there was no evidence for infectious liver disease, paucity of intrahepatic bile ducts, fetal hemochromatosis a-1-antitrypsin deficiency or cystic fibrosis as potential contributing factors.",0
"In conclusion, the presented results illustrate that morphological/cytochemical data and in situ hybridization of mtDNA provide valuable information in diagnosing mtDNA depletion. mtDNA depletion in the liver should be suspected on light microscopy when severe ballooning, bilurubinostasis and steatosis and giant hepatocytes are present. On electron microscopy the most characteristic signs for mtDNA depletion are the accumulation of abnormal mitochondria with tubular cristae or lack of cristae [11, 62]. Cytochemistry/immunocytochemistry combined with in situ hybridization of mtDNA are especially suited for the detection of mosaic tissue involvement. If biochemical evidence (decreased activity of respiratory chain complexes I, III and IV) in liver also",0
"supports the mitochondrial origin, it can give further support for the depletion, if molecular genetic data are in the border-line range. Our data show that mutations in POLG lead to heterogenous depletion of mtDNA in liver, skeletal and heart and to a mosaic defect pattern even in the severely affected liver. Secondary dysregulation of other proteins involved in mtDNA maintenance like mtTFA and mtSSB probably aggravate the defect and may thereby promote the development of a mosaic defect pattern. The results help to explain the occasionally observed recovery from mtDNA depletion.",0

Repeated status epilepticus required invasive ventilation and at times the use of more than four anticonvulsant drugs simultaneously.

Discussion",0
"Although the understanding of the molecular defects of Alpers disease has increased over recent years, the exact relationship between the molecular defect and the phenotype remains very complex. Clayton described in 1982 how the 16569-bp human mitochondrial genome is replicated and repaired by DNA polymerase-c (POLG) [7]. The ﬁrst pathogenic mutations of POLG were described in 2001 in families with autosomal dominant chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia [8]. Tissue-speciﬁc mtDNA deletions were later identiﬁed as causes of deﬁciencies in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation [9].",0
Different and overlapping disease entities ranging from psychiatric disturbances to primary neurological diseases and endocrine disturbances have been associated with POLG mutation. Mutations in POLG gene account for approximately 90% of the classical phenotype of Alpers disease [10]. One in 50 people are thought to be silent heterozygote carriers of POLG mutations.,0
"Most cases with childhood onset Alpers disease are associated with at least one mutation in the linker region of the POLG gene and one in the polymerase domain. The most common disease mutation in POLG associated with Alpers disease, as in our patient, is the G-to-A mutation at nucleotide 1399 in exon 7 of POLG causing an alanine to threonine amino acid substitution at codon 467. In the Belgian population the p.A467T mutation has been observed at a frequency of 0.6% without showing clinical signs [6].",0

"Molecular testing revealed a compound heterozygous mutation in the POLG-1 gene on chromosome 15q25. A missense mutation in the polymerase domain in exon 16 leading to p.G848S exchange (c.2542G > A) and a missense mutation in the linker region in exon 7 leading to p.A467T exchange (c.1399G > A) was identiﬁed. The ﬁrst mutation was derived from the mother the latter from the father of the child, both being healthy. Both mutations have previously been described as compound heterozygosity in patients with Alpers disease [3]. Treatment",1
"Faced with the deteriorating clinical situation of an intractable epileptic syndrome impressing as epilepsia partialis continua, refractory to common antiepileptic drugs, we asked for parental consent to administer pharmacologic doses of folinic acid (5-formyltetrahydrofolate, Leucovorine) in order to compensate for the intracerebral folate deﬁciency. Treatment was started with a daily oral dose of 2 x 0.25 mg/kg body weight and later increased to 2 x 4 mg/kg/body weight).",1
"A remarkable clinical improvement could be observed thereafter. After 2 weeks we could start to reduce the anticonvulsant treatment from four to two drugs. For 17 months under a combined anticonvulsant drug regime with Phenobarbitone and Viga- Table 1 Neurotransmitter metabolites, folates, cytokines in CSF and autoantibodies against folate receptor in serum and CSF of a patient with Alpers disease.",0

"batrin no more status epilepticus and a marked reduction of focal seizures could be witnessed. During the months of folinic acid substitution therapy the EEG remained highly pathological, although high-amplitude slow waves decreased and speciﬁc epileptic activity appeared less pronounced.",1
"On the clinical side we witnessed an improvement of communication skills of the child. Whereas before there was no interaction possible between the parents and their daughter, a prompt response of the child could be observed when the child was spoken to or touched by the parents. The girl was able to indicate physical discomfort such as a full bladder. Cortical blindness seemed much less apparent, swallowing difﬁculties were diminished. At the age of 5½ the girl passed away without an apparent deterioration.",1
"During folinic acid supplementation follow-up investigations showed a rise in CSF FR-autoantibody titers coinciding with a decrease of 5MTHF levels prompting us to increase the folinic acid doses. At disease onset IL-6 was increased 3000 times the expected value and almost approached normal values in the course of the disease, whereas IL-8 still remained elevated with an increment at 1500 times the expected value (Table 1). Discussion",0
"Although the understanding of the molecular defects of Alpers disease has increased over recent years, the exact relationship between the molecular defect and the phenotype remains very complex. Clayton described in 1982 how the 16569-bp human mitochondrial genome is replicated and repaired by DNA polymerase-c (POLG) [7]. The ﬁrst pathogenic mutations of POLG were described in 2001 in families with autosomal dominant chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia [8]. Tissue-speciﬁc mtDNA deletions were later identiﬁed as causes of deﬁciencies in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation [9].",0
Different and overlapping disease entities ranging from psychiatric disturbances to primary neurological diseases and endocrine disturbances have been associated with POLG mutation. Mutations in POLG gene account for approximately 90% of the classical phenotype of Alpers disease [10]. One in 50 people are thought to be silent heterozygote carriers of POLG mutations.,0
"Most cases with childhood onset Alpers disease are associated with at least one mutation in the linker region of the POLG gene and one in the polymerase domain. The most common disease mutation in POLG associated with Alpers disease, as in our patient, is the G-to-A mutation at nucleotide 1399 in exon 7 of POLG causing an alanine to threonine amino acid substitution at codon 467. In the Belgian population the p.A467T mutation has been observed at a frequency of 0.6% without showing clinical signs [6].",0
"In Alpers disease the p.A467T mutation is either homozygous or paired in trans with other mutations in POLG. In the case of compound heterozygosity there is a polymerase activity of only 4% comparing to the wild-type DNA [11]. It is thus the nature of the mutation in the second POLG allele in compound heterozygous patients that inﬂuences the severity and type of the disease. More prolonged disease courses with less severe symptoms have been described and seemed to be associated with a homozygous mutation [10,12].",0
"The symptomatic epilepsy in Alpers disease is usually refractory to common antiepileptic drug treatment. Epileptic status is often the terminating event. The use of valproic acid as an anticonvulsant drug has repeatedly led to a terminal hepatic failure and should be avoided [13]. The natural course of the disease is progressive with death occurring in most cases within 6–12 months after the onset of the disease. A gene dosage effect is thought to be an important determinant for age of onset, the severity, and course of the disease.",0
"We justiﬁed giving 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (calcium folinate) in the form of Leucovorin taking the following into consideration: Folic acid is a water soluble vitamin that is converted into various reduced forms involved in synthesis of purine and pyrimidine bases, methylation of genomic DNA, conversion of homocysteine to methionine, transfer of methyl-groups, and formation of the active methyl-group donor S-adenosylmethionine, used in various methylation reactions. Furthermore folates exert a direct inﬂuence on brain function through the enhanced biosynthesis of phospholipids and hence myelination.",0
The physiological plasma folate form 5MTHF is actively transferred across the blood–brain barrier by a folate receptor mediated endocytotic process in choroid epithelial cells and reaches 2–4-fold higher concentration in the spinal ﬂuid as compared to serum.,0
"A balanced diet usually provides sufﬁcient quantities of folate to the CNS. However, the presence of folate receptor autoantibodies, oxidative stress and secondary inﬂammatory responses are able to block folate transfer across the choroid plexus to the CNS. Such primary and secondary forms of cerebral folate deﬁciency (CFD) with an encephalopathic symptomatology have extensively been described in the infantile-onset CFD syndrome [14], mitochondrial encephalopathies [15], Kearns-Sayre syndrome [16], Rett syndrome [17,18], and Aicardi-Goutières syndrome [19]. The use of antifolate drugs in rare inborn errors of metabolism like deﬁciency of dihydropteridine reductase, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, aromatic aminoacid decarboxylase and 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase should be excluded [14].",0
"The low CSF levels of 5MTHF in our patient can be explained by blocked transport across the blood–brain barrier due to the presence of FR autoantibodies as well as by increased utilization and catabolism of 5MTHF due to oxidative stress [16]. Another explanation may be a defective transport due to ATP depletion in the choroid plexus, as seen in Kearns-Sayre syndrome.",0
"Of interest are the relative high concentrations of neurotransmitter metabolites 5HIAA, HVA, and 3OMD in CSF. Both serotonin and catecholamines metabolism are intimately tied to both mitochondria and inﬂammation. An inﬂammatory event with IFN-c stimulation is known to lead to both increased tryptophan degra- dation (via indoleamine dioxygenase) and neopterin production (via GTP cyclohydrolase I) [20].",0
"The substitution with high doses of folinic acid will increase 5MTHF plasma concentrations even in the presence of blocking FR autoantibodies facilitating thereby an increased uptake of 5MTHF into the CSF compartment via the folate carrier. To treat the cerebral folate deﬁciency we have chosen an initial oral dose of 2 x 0.25 mg/kg body weight Leucovorine and later adapted the dose to reach age speciﬁc levels of CSF 5MTHF. We refrained from further augmenting the dose, since it is known that high folic acid doses can decrease blood levels of anticonvulsant drugs such as Phenobarbital and thereby potentially interfere with seizure control [21]. The medication was well tolerated and followed by a marked improvement of the child, though high CSF IL-8 levels reminded of the persisting pro-inﬂammatory process.",0
"Considering the possible mechanism of the observed effects, we speculate that repletion of folates within the CNS could lead to a partial repair of previously deranged folate-dependant pathways and mitochondrial dysfunction. To our knowledge in disorders of mtDNA deletions the role of folinic acid substitution has not been evaluated. At the moment we do not know to what extent the production of folate receptor autoantibodies in Alpers disease contribute to its pathophysiology, whether it represents a consistent ﬁnding or it is merely an epiphenomenon of the cerebral inﬂammatory response.",0

"Parkinsonism with1,2 or without3 chronic progressive ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) can be caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA polymerase g (POLG). POLG-associated Parkinsonism (POLG-P) is at least partially responsive to levodopa,1,2 but predictors of dopamine-response have not been reported. Of the plethora of different syndromes associated with POLG-mutations, depression and anxiety present common major therapeutic problems.4 Patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (IPD) frequently show improvement not only of motor symptoms but also of depression and anxiety after initiation of treatment with levodopa or dopamine agonists. Here, we present a patient with POLG-P whose Parkinsonism and depression showed sustained excellent response to dopaminergic treatment.",1
"A 55-year-old woman of Croatian origin presented with a 3-year history of slowly progressive facial masking, hypophonia, symmetric cogwheeling of the wrists, shufﬂing gait, marked bradykinesia, and positive pull test, yielding 47/108 points in the UPDRS motor score. Bilateral ptosis, incomplete CPEO, and exercise intolerance had been present for 10 years and had led to the previous misdiagnosis of myasthenia gravis. Severe depression, indicated by 43/63 points on the Beck Depression Inventory, had been noted for 3 years. Family history on the paternal side was positive for CPEO and ptosis, and both sons of the patient, aged 28 and 25 years, were suffering from ptosis, depression, and anxiety but had no extrapyramidal movement abnormalities. Two consecutive subcutaneous injections of apomorphine markedly reduced UPDRS motor scores from 47 to 27 points (243%) on 2.5 mg apomorphine and from 55 to 26 points",1
(253%) on 5 mg apomorphine (Supporting Table 1). The injections also lead to a rapid and marked amelioration of depressed mood. A long-term medication was initiated with extended release formulations of ropinirole (6 mg/d) and levodopa (100 mg/d).,0
"At 10 months follow-up, the patient presented with a sustained improvement of Parkinsonism and mood as evidenced by a decrease down to 20 points in the UPDRS motor score (257%) and to 4 points on the Beck Depression Inventory (291%) (Testing was done by an examiner blind to the results of the apomorphine tests; for details see Supporting Tables 1 and 2).

"123I-FP-CIT-DATScan demonstrated a severe symmetric reduction of nigrostriatal dopamine transporters similar to advanced IPD (Fig. 1B) and ruled out a depression-induced ‘‘pseudo-Parkinsonism.’’ In addition, transcranial sonography (performed by an examiner blind to the history and clinical examination of the patient) revealed a hyperechogenic substantia nigra and a hypoechogenic raphe (Fig 1D), thus resembling the characteristic sonography midbrain ﬁndings of IPD with depression.5 Because of the suggestive phenotype and family history, a genetic analysis of the POLG gene was initiated, revealing a heterozygous Tyr955Cys mutation, which is known to present, interalia, as POLG-P with autosomal dominant inheritance.1",1
"Our ﬁndings present close similarities between IPD and POLG-P: in contrast to other atypical Parkinson diseases like MSA-P or PSP-P, both entities feature predominant degeneration of nigro-striatal dopaminergic neurons, respond well not only to levodopa but also to dopamine agonists and display hyperechogenicity of the substantia nigra.",0
"These similarities are particularly interesting as increased levels of mtDNA deletion and respiratory chain deﬁciency have been found in substantia nigra neurons of IPD patients,6 thus suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction as part of the complex pathogenetic pathway of substantia nigra degeneration in IPD. As POLG mutations lead to elevated levels of oxidative stress and mtDNA damage,7 patients harboring these mutations might be at particular risk for IPD-like substantia nigra degeneration.",0
"Antidepressant effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists, especially of D4/D5 agonists like ropinirole, have been shown consistently in patients with IPD.8 Almost complete remission of depression in our patient might be partially attributed to her dramatic motor improvement but it is likely that speciﬁc dopaminergic effects like in IPD are also involved. Future studies are warranted to test whether depression in POLG-patients without Parkinsonism is also associated with a hypoechogenic raphe and responds to dopaminergic treatment as well.",0
"In conclusion, the large beneﬁt from dopaminergic therapy emphasizes the need to identify motor and nonmotor parkinsonian features also in the large majority of those POLGpatients that present with a multifaceted phenotype. Moreover, differentiating POLG-P from other forms of atypical Parkinsonism is of great importance because of the potential excellent response to dopaminergic medication. Transcranial sonography and apopmorphine testing could serve as inexpensive, easily available tests for facilitating a differential diagnosis and to predict treatment response of both motor and nonmotor symptoms.",0

"Camptocormia, also called bent spine syndrome, is an extreme ﬂexion of the trunk during walking that resolves in the supine position. Treatment attempts for this disabling condition are often unsuccessful. We describe a case of markedly improved camptocormia with the simple intervention of wearing a backpack.",0
"A 69-year-old man with Parkinson’s disease (PD) presented with progressive camptocormia for the prior 1.5 years. He had been diagnosed with PD 5 years earlier after the onset of left upper extremity resting tremor, shoulder pain, and bradykinesia. He had no discomfort when seated or supine, but with walking, he developed dramatic thoracolumbar ﬂexion associated with pain in the lower abdomen and back. The camptocormia was worse in the evenings; he reported ﬂexion approaching 908 at night compared with only slight ﬂexion in the mornings. The severity of camptocormia was unrelated to PD medication dosing, although his other PD motor symptoms responded well to dopaminergic therapy. It was exacerbated by carrying weight in front of him. It was alleviated by using a walker and with pressure on his lower back, a possible sensory trick. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was unremarkable and MRIs of thoracic and lumbar spine were notable for mild degenerative changes. Botulinum toxin A injections to the rectus abdominis muscles ﬁrst with 180 units and later with 360 units were ineffective. Muscle relaxants were also ineffective. Additional levodopa improved his PD symptoms and produced mild dyskinesias but did not improve the camptocormia.",0

"Neurologic exam, performed while PD medications were active, revealed normal muscle tone throughout, mild asymmetric bradykinesia, absence of tremor, and mild choreiform dyskinesias. He had mild age-appropriate thoracic kyphosis while seated and standing, but otherwise no abnormal anterior or lateral ﬂexion. He was examined in the morning, a time when he reported his truncal ﬂexion was relatively mild. After walking for about 30 s, he had onset of thoracolumbar ﬂexion that progressed for another 30 s to reach a maximum of ,408. This degree of ﬂexion was intolerably painful, caused him to stop walking and forced his trunk upright. He would then resume walking and the pattern would repeat. The rectus abdominis muscles were palpably tight during ﬂexion. The camptocormia was completely relieved when wearing a low-slung backpack weighing ,6 kg (video) and returned upon removal. It was also improved by using a wheeled walker or by pressing his back against the hallway handrail. He found the backpack less cumbersome and embarrassing than using a walker.",0
"In follow-up clinic visits, he reported a consistent immediate beneﬁt each time a backpack was worn. The beneﬁt was sustained, without decrement, for long durations (hours) and was terminated only by removal of the backpack.

Many patients have palpable contraction of the rectus abdominis, improvement with sensory tricks, and a diurnal pattern of exacerbation.1,4 Like other axial manifestations of PD, it responds poorly to levodopa.1,4 Other treatments including muscle-relaxants, botulinum toxin, and deep brain stimulation have been attempted but are unsatisfactory in many cases.1,5 Thoracolumbar orthoses have been tried but some are poorly tolerated and others, while beneﬁcial, require custom design and inpatient rehabilitation training.6",0

Her tremor was present at rest, in the maintenance of posture and on standing. Secondary causes of tremor were excluded. There was no familial history of neurological disorders. When she was ﬁrst admitted to our clinic, her neurological examination showed head and trunk tremor along with a moderate resting and postural tremor in the four limbs, predominant on the right side, and severe legs tremor during standing. Electrophysiological studies revealed involvement of agonist-antagonist distal muscles of upper and lower limbs at a frequency of 4 to 5 Hz, at rest and in the maintenance of posture (Fig. 1A) On standing, a rhythmic legs tremor at a frequency of 5 Hz, synchronous in proximal muscles and asynchronous in distal muscles was recorded (Fig. 1C). MRI scan of the brain was normal. [123I]- FP-CIT SPECT revealed integrity of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system. The patient had received various treatments (clonazepam, propranolol, primidone, etc.) in adequate dosage but these did not result in any signiﬁcant improvement. She complained of increased disability for daily life activities and was assessed for surgery. At the clinical follow-up (18 months after baseline evaluation), the patient showed asymmetric postural and resting tremor of the upper and lower limbs, and marked tremor of the trunk and lower limbs on standing position.

"At readmission, he was somnolent and responded only to tactile stimuli, with loss of extraocular movement on the right and right arm and leg spasticity and hyperreflexia. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed enlargement of previously identified lesions and new foci of T2 prolongation in the left frontoparietal subcortical white matter, genu of the corpus callosum, genu of the right internal capsule, anterior thalamus, and bilateral cerebellar hemispheres, with extension into the bilateral cerebellar peduncles. Subacute hemorrhage was present in the left thalamus and putamen (Figure 1B). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed an elevated lactate level, a markedly depressed N-acetylaspartate level, and a markedly elevated choline level in the left basal ganglia, findings most compatible with an aggressive tumor such as glioblastoma multiforme (Figure 1C). However, magnetic resonance perfusion studies showed no evidence of increased perfusion in the lesions, findings more consistent with a fulminant inflammatory process such as tumefactive demyelination than with neoplasm. Biopsy of the deep left frontal lesion revealed multiple fragments of heavily gliotic white matter diffusely infiltrated by abundant foamy histiocytes, scattered lymphocytes, and occasional plasma cells (Figure 2A). A myelin stain showed remarkable loss of myelin with macrophages containing myelin particles (Figure 2B). As expected, the reactive astrocytes were intensely highlighted by glial fibrillary acidic protein (Figure 2C), and the macrophages stained for the macrophage marker CD68 (Figure 2D).

The triad of sensory ataxic neuropathy, dysarthria, and ophthalmoparesis (SANDO) has been demonstrated in a small subset of patients with POLG1 mutations. We report a sporadic case of an 80-year-old compound heterozygote man who presented with SANDO and was found to have three known pathogenic mutations in the POLG1 gene (p.T251I/ p.P587L/p.G848S). To our knowledge, none of these mutations have been demonstrated previously in SANDO.

Quantitative motor unit analysis was performed on the right orbicularis oris muscle, employing the technique described by Farrugia and Kennett.9 It showed a mean motor unit action potential duration of 3.5 ms (normal range 7.2–11.0 ms), which was indicative of myopathy involving the facial muscles.",1

"Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome (AHS) (OMIM 203700) is a rare autosomal recessive disease associated with mitochondrial (mt) DNA depletion and mutations in the POLG gene.

"The human POLG (also known as POLG1 or pol γA) is localized on chromosome band 15q25 and spans nearly 18.5 kb with 23 exons. The 4464 bp transcript (NM_002693) encodes the 1239 aminoacid POLG1 protein. The mature protein is a 135-kDa polypeptide composed of three functional domains: an amino-terminal 3′-5′ exonuclease (exo) domain responsible for the ﬁdelity of mtDNA replication (Longley et al., 2001), a linker domain and a carboxy-terminal polymerase (pol)",0
"domain (Ropp and Copeland, 1996; Lecrenier et al., 1997). The 50-kDa POLG2 (or pol γB) subunit encoded by the POLG2 gene (chr 17q21) acts as a processivity factor accelerating polymerisation rate, in addition to increasing afﬁnity of pol γ for DNA (Lim et al., 1999; Farge et al., 2007).",0
"Human DNA pol γ is known to be an effective in vitro reverse transcriptase (RNA-directed DNA polymerase) and a possible physiological role for this reverse transcriptase activity has been suggested (Murakami et al., 2003). The most sensitive assays developed to date for the measurement of polg γ activity used homopolymeric RNA templates. Clinical assays were performed on mitochondria isolated from skeletal muscle (Naviaux et al., 1999) or cultured ﬁbroblasts (Taanman et al., 2009). Characterization of the enzyme has been assessed in vitro with puriﬁed or recombinant pol γ (Carrodeguas et al., 1999; Farr et al., 1999; Lee and Johnson, 2007) or in vivo by expressing a POLG1 fusion protein in human cultured cells (Spelbrink et al., 2000).",0

For both patients, cDNA study showed that both the GATA duplication and the donor splice site alteration cause a splicing defect leading to partial or complete skipping of exon 22. The mechanisms inducing exon 22 skipping in these patients are discussed.",0
"To ﬁnd out if these POLG mutants could be responsible for the AHS phenotype, we performed assays of pol γ activity in mitochondria from ﬁbroblasts.

At 1 year of age, she presented a rightsided clonic status epilepticus resistant to multiple antiepileptic drugs. Carbamazepine worsened myoclonic jerks. A ketogenic diet was well tolerated but was ineffective. Occipital frontal circumference was normal. EEG showed subcontinuous discharges of rythmic slow spike waves on the left hemisphere, related to right hand and foot clonic jerks. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 12 months of age was normal. At the same time, a dramatic psychomotor regression was observed with poor interaction, major global hypotonia and no eye contact due to cortical blindness. Mild lactic acidosis and elevated lactate/pyruvate ratio were documented in blood (lactate: 2.8 mmol/l;",1

Content of mtDNA was slightly reduced in muscle (62% of age-matched control mean) with no major abnormalities of the mitochondrial respiratory chain activities. A diagnosis of Alpers syndrome was suggested. In the following months, her neurological condition evolved into epilepsia partialis continua",1

"respiratory chain complexes of a muscle biopsy revealed a partial defect of the activities of the complexes I, II+III and IV (44, 52 and 63% of the mean control values, respectively). During the two following years, epilepsy was always very active including spasms and myoclonic jerks. At 46 months, valproate therapy was started because of refractory seizures. At the beginning, valproate was clinically well tolerated but no clear improvement of seizure frequency was noticed leading to the introduction of a ketogenic diet. This last therapy was stopped after 6 weeks because of intestinal intolerance. Despite stopping valproate, a rapidly progressive hepatic failure with increasing levels of transaminases and ammoniemia, hypoalbuminaemia and decrease of clotting factors led to the death of the child at 50 months of age. The diagnosis of Alpers syndrome was proposed and then conﬁrmed by the following analysis. Depletion of mtDNA in liver (86%) was demonstrated, associated with the defects of mtDNA-related respiratory chain complexes (17, 65% and 25% of the mean control values for the complexes I, III and IV, respectively).

Results Molecular investigations POLG sequence variations - Patient 1 is a compound heterozygote for two sequence variations: (i) the common c.1399GNA in exon 7 which predicts a substitution of Ala with Thr at codon 467 (p.Ala467Thr) (A467T) in the thumb subdomain of the protein pol domain (Naviaux and Nguyen, 2004; Lee et",1
"al., 2009), (ii) a novel GATA duplication (c.3626_3629dupGATA) located 14 nt before the 3′-end of exon 22. This duplication creates a premature termination codon (PTC) located 17 nt upstream from the intron 22. The mother was the carrier of the A467T and the father of the c.3626_3629dupGATA (not shown).",0
"- Patient 2: POLG of patient 2 harbored two heterozygous base changes: (i) the previously reported combination in cis p.[W748S; E1143G] (Van Goethem et al., 2004; Ferrari et al., 2005) (ii) the recently reported T to C substitution (c.3643+2TNC) abolishing the invariable consensus GT splice donor site of intron 22 (Roels et al., 2009). Patient 2 inherited the p.[W748S;E1143G] from his mother and the c.3643 + 2 TNC from his father (not shown). RT-PCR analysis",1
"To identify the impact of these variations on splicing, cDNAs from both patients and a control were ampliﬁed with primers located in exons 21 and 23. As expected for patient 2, two different ampliﬁcation products were revealed: an approx. 496 bp band of expected size and a 336 bp shorter one (Fig. 1, lane 3). Sequencing of these puriﬁed",0
"products demonstrated that the 496 bp fragment corresponded to exons 21–22–23 from the p.[W748S;E1143G] allele while the shorter one corresponded to exon 21 directly linked to exon 23 (Fig. 2). Thus, the c.3643+2TNC variation in patient 2 causes complete skipping of exon 22. Furthermore, exon 22 skipping introduces a PTC located one codon into the last exon 23, resulting in a C-terminal 78-amino-acid truncation of the protein.",0
"For patient 1 surprisingly, the same pattern of ampliﬁcation products was obtained (Fig. 1, lane 1) but the intensity of the 336 bp product was fainter than for patient 2. Sequencing of the normal size 496 bp product showed two different species: one bearing the GATA duplication and the other bearing the wild-type GATA sequence, and sequencing of the 336 bp shorter product showed exon 22 skipping",0
"Fig. 1. Ampliﬁcation of exons 21–23 from cDNAs of patients. Exons 21–23 of cDNAs were ampliﬁed using the exon 21 (forward) primer (nt 3356-3375) and the exon 23 (reverse) primer (nt 3851-3832).

"(Fig. 2). This cDNA study showed an unexpected splicing defect for patient 1 as two kinds of transcripts were produced from the GATA duplicated allele: one containing exon 22 with the GATA duplication and one with exon 22 skipping.

The",0
"ddTTP-sensitive incorporation of dTTP was used to calculate DNA polymerase γ activity. A 85–95% ddTTP sensitivity of the total dTTP incorporation was obtained in control and patients mitochondria. Similar results of ddTTP sensitivity were reported elsewhere (Naviaux et al., 1999; Spelbrink et al., 2000; Taanman et al., 2009).",0
"A low level of enzyme activity was measured in the mitochondria of both patients (Table 1): 18.8 U for patient 1 and 15.8 U for patient 2, compared to the controls (56.6 U± 17.8; n= 8) (range: 36.6–91.0). Residual activities were 33% and 28% of the mean control value for patients 1 and 2, respectively. Discussion",0
"We investigated POLG in two unrelated children presenting with Alpers syndrome. Patient 1 harbored the novel c.3626_3629dupGATA in exon 22 in trans with the common p.A467T and patient 2, the recently reported c.3643+2TNC in trans with the p.[W748S;E1143G]. In order to evaluate the consequences of the mutant alleles on POLG1 biochemical function, catalytic activity of DNA pol γ was assessed in organello on mitochondria-enriched preparations from cultured ﬁbroblasts. The A467T/c.3626_3629dupGATA and the [W748S;E1143G]/c.3643+2TNC enzymes showed a decreased catalytic rate (33% and 28% of the mean control activity for patients 1 and 2,",1
respectively).,0
"As both the c.3626_3629dupGATA and the c.3643+2TNC create a PTC and probably inactive proteins, the level of residual activity for each patient is to be likely the reﬂect of the A467T or the W748S; E1143G mutant proteins. It has been established that either the A467T or the [W748S;E1143G] recombinant proteins harbored decreased activity (Chan et al., 2005a, 2006). Recently, disease-associated pol γ variations have been divided into three classes (Lee et al., 2009). W748S and A467T are included into class II and class III, respectively. The class II variations are located in the DNA binding channel, leading to reduced DNA binding and lower polymerase activity. The most",0

"The human POLG (also known as POLG1 or pol γA) is localized on chromosome band 15q25 and spans nearly 18.5 kb with 23 exons. The 4464 bp transcript (NM_002693) encodes the 1239 aminoacid POLG1 protein. The mature protein is a 135-kDa polypeptide composed of three functional domains: an amino-terminal 3′-5′ exonuclease (exo) domain responsible for the ﬁdelity of mtDNA replication (Longley et al., 2001), a linker domain and a carboxy-terminal polymerase (pol)",0
"domain (Ropp and Copeland, 1996; Lecrenier et al., 1997). The 50-kDa POLG2 (or pol γB) subunit encoded by the POLG2 gene (chr 17q21) acts as a processivity factor accelerating polymerisation rate, in addition to increasing afﬁnity of pol γ for DNA (Lim et al., 1999; Farge et al., 2007).",0
"Human DNA pol γ is known to be an effective in vitro reverse transcriptase (RNA-directed DNA polymerase) and a possible physiological role for this reverse transcriptase activity has been suggested (Murakami et al., 2003). The most sensitive assays developed to date for the measurement of polg γ activity used homopolymeric RNA templates. Clinical assays were performed on mitochondria isolated from skeletal muscle (Naviaux et al., 1999) or cultured ﬁbroblasts (Taanman et al., 2009). Characterization of the enzyme has been assessed in vitro with puriﬁed or recombinant pol γ (Carrodeguas et al., 1999; Farr et al., 1999; Lee and Johnson, 2007) or in vivo by expressing a POLG1 fusion protein in human cultured cells (Spelbrink et al., 2000).",0

AHS is one of the six major groups of POLG disease deﬁned by Wong et al., 2008.",0
"In this study, we investigated POLG in two unrelated patients presenting with infantile-onset AHS. A novel GATA duplication in exon 22 and a yet reported donor splice site alteration in intron 22 were identiﬁed in a compound heterozygoty with the most common variation, p.A467T, and the p.[W748S;E1143G], respectively. For both patients, cDNA study showed that both the GATA duplication and the donor splice site alteration cause a splicing defect leading to partial or complete skipping of exon 22. The mechanisms inducing exon 22 skipping in these patients are discussed.",1
"To ﬁnd out if these POLG mutants could be responsible for the AHS phenotype, we performed assays of pol γ activity in mitochondria from ﬁbroblasts. We showed a signiﬁcant decrease of polymerase activity in organello for both patients, providing evidence that these POLG variations affect enzyme catalysis and play a major role in the AHS phenotype.

"This girl was the second child of non-consanguineous French parents with no clinical relevant family history. Height and weight growth decreased at 6 months of age. At 1 year of age, she presented a rightsided clonic status epilepticus resistant to multiple antiepileptic drugs. Carbamazepine worsened myoclonic jerks. A ketogenic diet was well tolerated but was ineffective. Occipital frontal circumference was normal. EEG showed subcontinuous discharges of rythmic slow spike waves on the left hemisphere, related to right hand and foot clonic jerks. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 12 months of age was normal. At the same time, a dramatic psychomotor regression was observed with poor interaction, major global hypotonia and no eye contact due to cortical blindness. Mild lactic acidosis and elevated lactate/pyruvate ratio were documented in blood (lactate: 2.8 mmol/l;",1
"normal: 0.5–2.0) (lactate/pyruvate ratio: 31; normal b 20). Elevation of cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) lactate was noticed twice (2.8 and 2.2 mmol/l; normal 1.4–2.0). CSF protein content was normal. Content of mtDNA was slightly reduced in muscle (62% of age-matched control mean) with no major abnormalities of the mitochondrial respiratory chain activities. A diagnosis of Alpers syndrome was suggested. In the following months, her neurological condition evolved into epilepsia partialis continua",1
"reinforced by recurrent episodes of tonic clonic seizures. At 16 months of age, liver enlargement was noticed associated with mild cytolysis (ASAT 90 IU/L, normal b 50) and increased level of gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) (138 IU/L; normal: 5–25). The prothrombine time and the clotting factors were decreased (II 36%, V 39%, VII 59%, and prothrombine time 48%). The patient died at 27 months of age of respiratory failure. Informed parental consent was obtained in agreement with the French recommendations for genetic analysis. Patient 2",1
"This boy was the ﬁrst child of healthy young unrelated French parents without relevant family history. At 16 months of age, he started a severe status epilepticus. CSF protein content was elevated (0.78 g/l; normal: 0.15–0.35). Cerebral MRI showed brain cortical atrophy with symmetrical thalamic T2 and Flair hyperintense signals associated with cytotoxic oedema within basal ganglia on diffusion sequences.

At 24 months of age, a new cerebral MRI conﬁrmed brain cortical atrophy associated with marked T2 hyperintense signals of the cerebellar dentate nuclei and of posterior periventricular white matter at a less extent.

"periventricular regions. One month later, a new acute episode occurred with diffuse hypotonia, lethargy and vomiting. Lactate was mild elevated in plasma (2.8 mmol/l; normal: 0.5–2.0 mmol/l) and in CSF (3.2 mmol/l; normal 1.4–2.0 mmol/l). CSF protein content was elevated at 0.59 g/l (normal 0.15–0.35 g/l). Enzymatic measurements of the",1
"respiratory chain complexes of a muscle biopsy revealed a partial defect of the activities of the complexes I, II+III and IV (44, 52 and 63% of the mean control values, respectively). During the two following years, epilepsy was always very active including spasms and myoclonic jerks. At 46 months, valproate therapy was started because of refractory seizures. At the beginning, valproate was clinically well tolerated but no clear improvement of seizure frequency was noticed leading to the introduction of a ketogenic diet. This last therapy was stopped after 6 weeks because of intestinal intolerance. Despite stopping valproate, a rapidly progressive hepatic failure with increasing levels of transaminases and ammoniemia, hypoalbuminaemia and decrease of clotting factors led to the death of the child at 50 months of age. The diagnosis of Alpers syndrome was proposed and then conﬁrmed by the following analysis. Depletion of mtDNA in liver (86%) was demonstrated, associated with the defects of mtDNA-related respiratory chain complexes (17, 65% and 25% of the mean control values for the complexes I, III and IV, respectively). Informed parental consent was obtained for this study.",1

"Dermal ﬁbroblast and amniotic ﬂuid cells were obtained from CBC Biotec, CRB-HCL. Shortly, ﬁbroblasts from forearm skin explants obtained from patients, family members and controls were cultured in Ham F10 medium supplemented with 12% of fetal calf serum, with penicillin, streptomycin and amphotericin B and 50 mg/L of uridine. Cells were routinely cultured in plastic ﬂasks (T175) at 37 °C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Cultures were checked for mycoplasma infection prior to all experiments. Mitochondriaenriched preparations from three T175 ﬂasks of cell lines were obtained as described previously (Mousson de Camaret et al., 2007). The pelleted mitochondria were resuspended to an approximate concentration of 10 g/L and kept in aliquots at −80 °C. Protein concentration was measured by the bicinchoninic acid method.",0
"Molecular investigations For mtDNA quantiﬁcation, continuous real-time quantitative PCR, with the ﬂuorescent SYBR green I double strand DNA-speciﬁc dye, was used to determine the copy number for three mitochondrial genes (ND2, ND5 and 16 S) and a nuclear gene (ATPsynβ), as described previously (Chabi et al., 2002). POLG exons 2–23 and intron/exon boundaries were ampliﬁed and",0
"sequenced from the genomic DNA of both patients and their parents. Total RNA was isolated from cultured skin ﬁbroblasts using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA samples were free of any contaminating DNA by treatment with the DNA-freeTM Kit (Ambion Inc.). Reverse transcription of RNA was performed with the GeneAmp® RNA PCR Core Kit (Applied Biosystems) as recommended by the supplier. Ampliﬁcation and sequencing of POLG cDNA were performed. To assess exon 22 skipping, PCR products with exon 21 and 23 primers were puriﬁed by agarose gel electrophoresis and extracted by the DNA and Gel Band Puriﬁcation Kit (GE Healthcare) and sequenced.

"NC_000015.8 (range 87679030….87660554, complement) and NM_002693.2. Enzymatic measurements The DNA pol γ activity was measured in mitochondria-enriched preparations from cultured ﬁbroblasts using the RNA-directed DNA polymerase assay with a procedure based on that described previously (Naviaux et al., 1999). Thawed mitochondria were lysed as reported (Mousson de Camaret et al., 2007). Serial dilutions of lysed mitochondria were prepared to obtain ﬁnal concentration of 0.15, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 μg per assay. The standard reaction mixture",0
"contained 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2 and 0.5 mM MnCl2, 10 mM DTT, 10 mg/L poly(rA) and 5 mg/L oligodT12–18 (Amersham Biosciences), 5 μM dTTP and 50 μCi/ml of [α-32P] dTTP (Perkin Elmer; 10 μCi/μl, 3000 Ci/mmol; 0.017 μM ﬁnal concentration) in a ﬁnal volume of 20 μl. Assays were initiated by addition of 0.15 to 1.5 μg of mitochondrial protein per assay and conducted at 37 °C during 30 min. The reaction was stopped at +4 °C",0
"and the amount of the reaction products was determined by spotting aliquots of 4 μl on Whatman DE-81 anion-exchange papers (Fischer Bioblock). The papers were then washed as described (Naviaux et al., 1999). For each dilution of mitochondria, a parallel assay was performed with 5 μM 2′,3′-dideoxythymidine 5′-triphosphate (ddTTP). Data obtained from each dilution were used to establish a regression line for each sample. Regression analysis was used to calculate speciﬁc activity according to Naviaux et al., 1999. DNA pol γ speciﬁc activity (ddTTP-sensitive) was obtained as the difference",0
"between the two parallel assays measured with and without ddTTP. One unit of speciﬁc activity (U) is given as the incorporation of one picomole of dTTP per min per mg of protein. Results Molecular investigations POLG sequence variations - Patient 1 is a compound heterozygote for two sequence variations: (i) the common c.1399GNA in exon 7 which predicts a substitution of Ala with Thr at codon 467 (p.Ala467Thr) (A467T) in the thumb subdomain of the protein pol domain (Naviaux and Nguyen, 2004; Lee et",1
"al., 2009), (ii) a novel GATA duplication (c.3626_3629dupGATA) located 14 nt before the 3′-end of exon 22. This duplication creates a premature termination codon (PTC) located 17 nt upstream from the intron 22. The mother was the carrier of the A467T and the father of the c.3626_3629dupGATA (not shown).",1
"- Patient 2: POLG of patient 2 harbored two heterozygous base changes: (i) the previously reported combination in cis p.[W748S; E1143G] (Van Goethem et al., 2004; Ferrari et al., 2005) (ii) the recently reported T to C substitution (c.3643+2TNC) abolishing the invariable consensus GT splice donor site of intron 22 (Roels et al., 2009). Patient 2 inherited the p.[W748S;E1143G] from his mother and the c.3643 + 2 TNC from his father (not shown). RT-PCR analysis",1
"To identify the impact of these variations on splicing, cDNAs from both patients and a control were ampliﬁed with primers located in exons 21 and 23. As expected for patient 2, two different ampliﬁcation products were revealed: an approx. 496 bp band of expected size and a 336 bp shorter one (Fig. 1, lane 3). Sequencing of these puriﬁed",0
"products demonstrated that the 496 bp fragment corresponded to exons 21–22–23 from the p.[W748S;E1143G] allele while the shorter one corresponded to exon 21 directly linked to exon 23 (Fig. 2). Thus, the c.3643+2TNC variation in patient 2 causes complete skipping of exon 22. Furthermore, exon 22 skipping introduces a PTC located one codon into the last exon 23, resulting in a C-terminal 78-amino-acid truncation of the protein.",0
"For patient 1 surprisingly, the same pattern of ampliﬁcation products was obtained (Fig. 1, lane 1) but the intensity of the 336 bp product was fainter than for patient 2. Sequencing of the normal size 496 bp product showed two different species: one bearing the GATA duplication and the other bearing the wild-type GATA sequence, and sequencing of the 336 bp shorter product showed exon 22 skipping",0

"(Fig. 2). This cDNA study showed an unexpected splicing defect for patient 1 as two kinds of transcripts were produced from the GATA duplicated allele: one containing exon 22 with the GATA duplication and one with exon 22 skipping. DNA pol γ measurements To assess the pathogenicity of the POLG gene variations in both patients, we used a RNA-directed DNA polymerase assay for mitochondria-enriched preparations from cultured ﬁbroblasts. The",0
"ddTTP-sensitive incorporation of dTTP was used to calculate DNA polymerase γ activity. A 85–95% ddTTP sensitivity of the total dTTP incorporation was obtained in control and patients mitochondria. Similar results of ddTTP sensitivity were reported elsewhere (Naviaux et al., 1999; Spelbrink et al., 2000; Taanman et al., 2009).",0
"A low level of enzyme activity was measured in the mitochondria of both patients (Table 1): 18.8 U for patient 1 and 15.8 U for patient 2, compared to the controls (56.6 U± 17.8; n= 8) (range: 36.6–91.0). Residual activities were 33% and 28% of the mean control value for patients 1 and 2, respectively. Discussion",0
"We investigated POLG in two unrelated children presenting with Alpers syndrome. Patient 1 harbored the novel c.3626_3629dupGATA in exon 22 in trans with the common p.A467T and patient 2, the recently reported c.3643+2TNC in trans with the p.[W748S;E1143G]. In order to evaluate the consequences of the mutant alleles on POLG1 biochemical function, catalytic activity of DNA pol γ was assessed in organello on mitochondria-enriched preparations from cultured ﬁbroblasts. The A467T/c.3626_3629dupGATA and the [W748S;E1143G]/c.3643+2TNC enzymes showed a decreased catalytic rate (33% and 28% of the mean control activity for patients 1 and 2,",1
respectively).,0
"As both the c.3626_3629dupGATA and the c.3643+2TNC create a PTC and probably inactive proteins, the level of residual activity for each patient is to be likely the reﬂect of the A467T or the W748S; E1143G mutant proteins. It has been established that either the A467T or the [W748S;E1143G] recombinant proteins harbored decreased activity (Chan et al., 2005a, 2006). Recently, disease-associated pol γ variations have been divided into three classes (Lee et al., 2009). W748S and A467T are included into class II and class III, respectively. The class II variations are located in the DNA binding channel, leading to reduced DNA binding and lower polymerase activity. The most",0

"The c.3643+2TNC identiﬁed in the POLG gene from patient 2 induces complete exon 22 skipping from the transcript. Substitution affecting the invariant GT dinucleotide at the donor splice results either in the use of a preexisting but weaker cryptic donor site or in exon skipping (Krawczak et al., 1992). The transcript lacking exon 22 has a PTC in exon 23 and is not destroyed by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway as this PTC is in the last exon. The truncated protein encoded by this abnormal transcript would have only 46% of the C-terminal pol subdomain (Lee et al., 2009) and could be misfolded and sent for degradation.",0
"The c.3626_3629dupGATA allele has two different transcripts both containing a PTC and both escaping NMD: 1) a full length carrying the duplication resulting in a PTC in exon 22 and 2) a transcript with a skipped exon 22. The PTC created by the duplication 17 nt upstream from the last exon junction complex (EJC) is not located at least 50–55 nt upstream from at least one EJC as described previously in the 873-X allele (Chan et al., 2005b). This PTC results in a truncated protein",0
"lacking the last 31-aminoacids and removing 21% of the C-terminal pol subdomain (Lee et al., 2009) and probably sent for degradation. These two abnormal transcripts arising from the duplicated allele are not targets for NMD as described for other POLG transcripts containing PTC (Chan et al., 2005b, 2009). Whatever the relative amount of these two abnormal transcripts, they lead obviously to truncated proteins and haploinsufﬁciency.",0

For patients and controls, two different aliquots of mitochondria were submitted to serial dilutions (0.15 to 1.5 μg of proteins per assay). Each dilution was measured twice and data are averaged. Speciﬁc activity (U) was calculated as described in Subjects and methods. For patients, U values are the mean of two independent measurements with each value in parentheses. For controls, U value is the mean for eight control lines within the age range of patients. SD: standard deviation. (n): number of samples. (%): percentage of the mean control value.",0
"splicing silencers (ESS). Exon inclusion/skipping is a result of a ﬁne balance between enhancers and silencers both in constitutive and alternative splicing. These sequences are bound by serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins for many ESE and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNP) for ESS (Jurica and Moore, 2003). To test the hypothesis that the c.3626_3629dupGATA could involve a SRE, the normal and duplicated sequences were submitted to search for ESE/ESS motifs with Human Splicing Finder (HSF) website (Desmet et al., 2009). No signiﬁcant change of the motif-scores for four SR proteins (SF2/ASF, SC35, SRp40 and SRp55) was observed in the GATA duplicated sequence compared with the wild-type sequence. But, when screening for ESS motifs, it appears that the GATA duplication creates a new binding site (TAGATA) for hnRNP A1 with a signiﬁcant strength. Binding of hnRNP A1 on a fraction of the transcript with the duplicated sequence could be responsible for the partial exon 22 skipping observed in cDNA from patient 1. Although this should be experimentally demonstrated, a recent paper (Woolfe et al., 2010) showed a clear enrichment for silencer creation in splice affecting genome variants.",0
"In conclusion, two different mechanisms are involved in the haploinsufﬁciency in these patients, i.e. PTC and partial exon 22 skipping for patient 1, complete exon 22 skipping for patient 2, and the severe AHS phenotype in these patients was a consequence of a single-copy gene dose of the p.A467T or the p.[W748S;E1143G] allele.

"The etiology of most cases of spontaneous 46,XX primary ovarian insufficiency (sPOI) is unknown, however, associations have been made between mitochondrial diseases due to mutated mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (POLG) and sPOI. Here, we show that in 201 women with 46,XX sPOI, RFLP analysis of genomic DNA shows only one case (0.5%, 95% CI <3%) of heterozygosity for a mtDNA POLG mutation, suggesting that this is not a common genetic etiology for this form of infertility.",0
"Spontaneous 46,XX primary ovarian insufficiency (sPOI), also known as premature ovarian failure (POF), affects ~1% of women before age 40. sPOI is characterized by abnormal menses, menopausal FSH, and estrogen deficiency due to primary ovarian dysfunction. In ~90% of cases, the etiology is unknown. Recently, several genetic abnormalities have been highly associated with sPOI, including mutations in mitochondrial DNA polymerase-γ (POLG) (1-4).",0
"POLG is the only DNA polymerase responsible for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication and repair, thus it is essential for mitochondrial function. Several POLG mutations have been described, resulting in deletions or point mutations in mtDNA and decreased polymerase activity. Although there is a spectrum in the degree of insufficiency in polymerase activity, the most severe mutations lead to loss of >99% of polymerase function and cell death due to insufficient cellular energy production (5). Autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) was the first disease associated with POLG mutations (3,6). Additional POLG-driven mitochondrial diseases include Parkinson’s disease (PD), epilepsy, ataxia, psychiatric illnesses (1,6-9), and primary gonadal insufficiency in both men and women (1-4). In women, sPOI co-segregates with PEO and Parkinson’s in heterozygous POLG mutation carriers, suggesting mtDNA polymerase activity is required for both normal neurologic and ovarian function (1).

Women aged 18-42 with 46,XX sPOI (n=201) were recruited between August 2004 and March 2006 as part of an ongoing cross-sectional study evaluating the health of women with sPOI (11). Women with known iatrogenic cause of POI were excluded. 46,XX sPOI was defined as abnormal menses for at least four months, menopausal range FSH levels confirmed on two occasions at least one month apart, and age less than 40 at the time of diagnosis.

FSH was elevated into the menopausal range in all women (mean FSH 77.4 +/− 37.8 U/L), with corresponding low serum estradiol levels (mean E2 44.5 +/− 42.7 pg/mL). 112 (56%) women were tested for a premutation in the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. 3 of these women (3%) carry the FMR1 premutation (defined as 55-199 CGG repeats on the FMR1 gene), which itself infers approximately a 20% risk of developing sPOI",0

Only 1 of the 201 women we screened (0.5%) demonstrated heterozygosity for a single POLG mutation--c2857C>T (R953C) (Table 1). Based on this observation, 95% confidence level indicates the frequency of these POLG mutations accounts for <3% of cases of 46,XX sPOI.",1
"The woman found to have a heterozygous POLG mutation was an otherwise healthy, 28year old Caucasian. She had menarche at age 11 and normal monthly menses until age 28, at which time she developed oligomenorrhea (menses every 3 to 4 months). She was diagnosed with sPOI after fertility workup showed menopausal range FSH. She had been attempting pregnancy for approximately 5 years without success. In addition to sPOI, she had one co- Tong et al. Page 3",1
"morbid medical condition, Meniere’s syndrome, characterized by episodic vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss due to damage to the inner ear. She had no current or past history of anxiety or depression, and no autoimmune disorders. Family history was negative for infertility, sPOI or other menstrual irregularity; neurologic disorders, including PEO or PD; and, except for alopecia in a maternal grandmother, negative for autoimmune disease. At the NIH, this patient’s mean serum FSH was 72.7 U/L, LH 53.7 U/L, estradiol 58.2 pg/mL, and progesterone 0.5 ng/mL. Anti-adrenal and 21-hydroxylase antibodies were negative. FMR1 premutation testing was normal, ruling out Fragile X-associated POI. Transvaginal ultrasound showed an 8 mm endometrial stripe, a 2.4×2.5×0.9 cm left ovary without evident follicles and a 2.7×1.0×2.3 cm right ovary with one 9 mm follicle.",1
"The POLG R953C mutation has not been definitively associated with sPOI, although such a relationship has been suggested by its association with a Parkinson’s-like syndrome that cosegregates with POI within families (1). Thus, the POLG R953C mutation may be a rare cause of sPOI due to mitochondrial dysfunction. A direct relationship between the R953C mutation and sPOI cannot be determined from this study. However, previous work has shown that neither the R953C nor any other POLG mutations were present among 1640 healthy controls (1), suggesting the possibility of a causal association with this fertility disorder. However, whether R953C is a rare DNA sequence variant or a true functional mutation cannot be determined from this study or previous studies, given that impaired function due to the mutation has not been demonstrated in vitro. Further investigation is needed to clarify this.",1
"Together, these data demonstrate that these five POLG mutations are not a prevalent etiology of sPOI. This is in agreement with similar studies in infertile males, in which patients were screened for POLG CAG repeat polymorphisms that had previously been associated with primary gonadal insufficiency (14,15). Only 3% of infertile males screened were found to be homozygous carriers of the mutations, and half of these reported successful pregnancies despite presence of the mutation. In addition, 1% of fertile males were found to be homozygous carriers, providing further evidence that POLG dysfunction may not be a factor in primary gonadal insufficiency in men (16).",0
"The POLG mutations most commonly associated with sPOI to date, Y955C and R943H (1,3,4), were not seen in any of the women we screened. The prevalence of POLG mutations is estimated to be as high as 1% in certain populations, including the U.S. (17). We cannot exclude the possibility that screening a larger number of patients would have shown more cases of POLG mutations associated with sPOI. Further, we only tested for 5 of the >20 described POLG mutations, thus we are unable to exclude the possibility that mutations other than those we tested associate with sPOI.",0
"Whether ovarian dysfunction due to POLG mutations is due to follicle depletion or follicle dysfunction is not known. Oocytes have the highest mtDNA copy number of all cells (18), which increases their susceptibility to mtDNA depletion, and suggests a role for follicular depletion. On the other hand, oxidative phosphorylation, and thus mtDNA, is required for follicular development (19), suggesting follicle dysfunction may be responsible. Indeed, infertility in men believed to be due to POLG mutations is never due to azoospermia, but seems to be associated with defective spermatogenesis and/or steroidogenesis (14).",0

"Polymerase gamma is essential for mitochondrial DNA replication. Mutations in the nuclear gene encoding the catalytic subunit of mtDNA polymerase gamma (POLG1) are associated with mitochondrial diseases [1]. POLG1 mutations have been implicated in progressive external ophthalmoplegia [2], sensory ataxic neuropathy [3], parkinsonism [4], premature menopause [4], Alpers’ syndrome [5, 6], and mixed phenotypes [7, 8]. There appears no strict relationship between phenotype and genotype in patients with pathogenic mutations in the gene that encodes for POLG1 [8].",0
"Alpers’ syndrome usually presents in early childhood with the classical triad of developmental delay, intractable seizures and hepatic failure, which may be precipitated by valproic acid [3, 5–8]. In 2008, a new POLG1 mutation phenotype was described, features of which are refractory epilepsy and visual symptoms in previously healthy adolescents or young adults, the so-called juvenile-onset Alpers’ syndrome [9, 10]. Both Alpers’ phenotypes are characterized by refractory epilepsy with recurrent status epilepticus and episodes of epilepsia partialis continua, which often necessitate admission to the intensive-care unit (ICU) and pose an important mortality risk [10].",0
"Intravenous magnesium is the first choice agent in treating convulsions in eclampsia [11], and may be effective in status epilepticus of other origin, although reports on this topic are sparse [12–14]. We present two cases of non-related teenage girls with juvenile-onset Alpers’ syndrome due to POLG1 mutations who presented with refractory seizures that originated in the occipital lobe and were eventually successfully treated with magnesium. Case 1",1
"A previously healthy 19-year-old woman was admitted to our tertiary care center after two generalized tonic clonic seizures in a fortnight. Since the first seizure, she complained of seeing bright spots. Routine neurological examination and brain-CT at admission showed no abnormalities. Visual field examination revealed a rightsided homonymous paracentral scotoma. FLAIR and T2weighted MRI showed bilateral lesions with increased signal intensity in the occipital cortex, most prominent in the left hemisphere, with areas of both increased and decreased diffusion on ADC maps. EEG showed slowing of the background activity and continuous epileptic activity over the occipital areas, also most prominent in the left hemisphere. Her visual symptoms were therefore interpreted as focal occipital status epilepticus. Treatment with phenytoin and continuous intravenous infusion of",1
clonazepam were initiated. This improved the visual complaints but they did not resolve completely.,0
"Five weeks after the first seizure, while still on phenytoin and clonazepam she experienced right-sided focal motor seizures that only partially responded to additional therapy with clobazam and levetiracetam. Since a POLG1 mutation syndrome was suspected, valproic acid was avoided. Treatment with midazolam resulted in temporary resolution of focal convulsions, but her visual complaints did not improve and ictal activity persisted on EEG with right-sided hemiparesis. Her mental status deteriorated as she became disoriented, with dysphasia and acalculia. Repeated MRI showed an increase in the extent and number of the cortical occipital lesions, now including leftsided pulvinar thalamic abnormalities. Urgent DNA analysis indeed revealed a homozygous (A467T) mutation of the POLG1-gene confirming the diagnosis of juvenileonset Alpers’ syndrome.",1
"Her condition worsened as she developed frequent simple left-sided partial motor seizures, which gradually transformed into generalized status epilepticus. She was admitted to the ICU and treated with high-dose intravenous midazolam (0.4 mg/kg/h), and a combination of phenytoin (300 mg/day i.v.), clonazepam (3 mg/day i.v.) and levetiracetam (1,500 mg/day i.v.), and ventilatory support Fig. 1 Timetable with overview of anti-epileptic drugs.

High-dose oral topiramate (1,000 mg/day) somewhat decreased the frequency of the seizures but the EEGs remained highly abnormal, showing encephalopathic changes with continuous epileptic activity. Magnesium infusion was then introduced, aiming to increase serum levels from 0.81 mmol/l to approximately 3.5 mmol/l, leading almost instantly to complete abolishment of her clinical seizures. Midazolam was tapered, and she was extubated the following day. At time of extubation, serum magnesium level was 3.8 mmol/l. After extubation, she was able to communicate, although she remained somnolent.",1
"Although clinical signs of seizures remained absent, the patient developed sepsis, probably due to ventilator associated pneumonia, leading to multi-organ failure and death 2 weeks after admission to the ICU. Case 2",1
"In December 2008, a previously healthy 17-year-old girl complained of impaired vision and light flashes for several weeks. She was evaluated in another hospital after a 15-min episode of confusion and suspected convulsions. She fully recovered and was diagnosed with migraine. Two days later, she had two generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and was admitted to our hospital. Neurological examination revealed dysphasia, right-sided hemiparesis and intermittent partial motor seizures of her right leg. T2 and FLAIR MRI showed hyperintense lesions of the left occipital cortex, thalamus, and mesial temporal lobe. One week after admission, DNA analysis revealed a homozygous A467T mutation of the POLG1-gene, confirming the suspected diagnosis of juvenile-onset Alpers’ syndrome. Fourteen years earlier, her teenage sister had generalized status epilepticus. She died without an established diagnosis after a complicated brain biopsy.",1
"While being treated with phenytoin (Fig. 1), her EEG showed a continuing focal status epilepticus of the left occipital region, spreading anteriorly. Continuous intravenous infusion of midazolam and levetiracetam were added and she was admitted to the ICU for ventilatory support. When high-dose midazolam (0.3 mg/kg/h), levetiracetam (2,000 mg/day i.v.), and phenytoin (300 mg/day i.v.) could not abolish focal status epilepticus, magnesium infusion was started, aiming to increase serum levels from",1
"0.85 mmol/l to approximately 3.5 mmol/l. Paresis and dysphasia both gradually improved within hours after the start of magnesium infusion and within 12 h midazolam was tapered and she was extubated with at that time a serum magnesium level of 2.0 mmol/l. EEG after extubation showed improvement, although there was still a focal occipital status epilepticus (Fig. 2).",1
"When magnesium was tapered and midazolam was discontinued, focal convulsions of her right arm recurred, for which midazolam (0.1 mg/kg/h) was restarted in addition to magnesium, phenytoin, and clobazam. Convulsions ceased and the right-sided (post-)ictal paresis and dysphasia disappeared. Gradually, midazolam and magnesium were stopped and oral phenytoin, clobazam, and levetiracetam were continued. The patient could be discharged 1 month after admission, and she remains without seizures up to now, 8 months after discharge. Her EEG at discharge showed subtle focal occipital epileptic discharges, although there was an obvious improvement compared to previous EEGs.",1
Discussion,0
"Juvenile-onset Alpers’ syndrome is characterized by refractory epilepsy, predominating in the occipital lobe, with frequent episodes of spreading and status epilepticus, for which a combination of several anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) is often required [10]. Benzodiazepines are the main-stay in the treatment of status epilepticus, but often necessitate ventilatory support. Importantly, valproic acid should be avoided, since it carries a high risk of inducing hepatic failure. In our own experience, propofol and thiopental may also lead to hepatic failure and rapid neurological deterioration in children with Alpers’ syndrome. In juvenile-onset patients with POLG1 mutations, these drugs should perhaps also be avoided. When the combination of several high-dose AEDs could not stop focal or generalized status epilepticus in our two patients, we chose to add magnesium according to the use in (pre-)eclampsia [11]. The anticonvulsive effect of magnesium has been well established in (pre-)eclampsia, but it is rarely used in the treatment of epilepsy of other origin. In (pre-)eclampsia, an immediate effect is pursued by a loading dose of magnesium sulphate followed by continuous infusion for 24 h, resulting in serum magnesium levels of 1.7–3.5 mmol/l [15], but even at these high doses, side-effects are mild and sparse [11, 16]. In particular, renal or hepatic failure due to high-dose magnesium therapy have not been described. Although magnesium is effective in preventing and treating eclampsia, its mechanism of action remains unclear. One of the suggested anticonvulsant mechanisms is its action as a N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA-) receptor antagonist. The NMDA-receptor is a glutamate receptor which, when activated, leads to a massive depolarization of neuronal networks and bursts of action potentials. Magnesium may act to increase the seizure threshold by blocking the NMDA-receptors [15]. Animal models suggest that AEDs enhancing GABA-receptor activation (e.g., barbiturates and benzodiazepines) are effective in the",0

"Quantitative morphology of gross retinal histology in humans can be measured in vivo using time domain Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). In PD a thinning of the peripapillary retinal nerve ﬁber layer, which represents axons of the ganglion cells, and macula have been shown, supporting the hypothesis that dopaminergic deﬁcit in the retina can cause structural changes.2–5 However, the usefulness of measuring foveal thickness by OCT as a diagnostic tool to differentiate PD from other tremor disease, such as essential tremor (ET) remains unknown. Therefore, the main purpose of this pilot study was to measure foveal thickness in patients with PD, and to compare it against a normal population and patients with ET.",0
"We designed a cross-sectional pilot study that included a consecutive sample of outpatients diagnosed with idiopathic PD in accordance with the UK Parkinson’s Disease Society brain bank, and ET based on clinical criteria. Patients with any coexisting ocular disease were excluded. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the General Yagu¨e Hospital, Burgos (Spain), and all patients signed the informed consent before being enrolled. Control subjects were matched for age (6 5 years) and gender to PD patients. Demographic and PD/ET laterality data were collected. OCT was acquired through a dilated pupil by an experienced operator using the OCT3 (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, Calif), with axial resolution of < 10 lm. The macular thickness map analysis and the center foveal thickness was automatically determined by the OCT3 software.6 Images were considered to be of good quality if the signal-to-noise ratio was greater than 30dB or had more than 95% sweeps accepted.",0

The mean foveal thickness was thinner in the PD group compared with the ET group and controls (Table 1). For the PD and ET groups, the mean foveal thickness was also thinner in the contra lateral eye of the most affected side (Table 1).",0
"In this pilot study, based on the OCT imaging, the fovea was thinner in the PD group compared with the ET group and controls. Interestingly, whereas interocular macular symmetry has been found in the normal population,7 we found that the foveal thickness was asymmetric and thinner in the eye contralateral to the side more affected by tremor and parkinsonism in the ET and PD groups, respectively. Hajee et al, also found the correlation between thinning in the left and the right eye of the same was not perfect.7 Hence, this interocular foveal asymmetry should be considered in interpretation. Except that for ET, although mild tremor asymmetry has been documented as a fundamental characteristic of ET, there is no published information regarding foveal thickness in patients with ET. The similar asymmetry ﬁnding in ET is difﬁcult to understand, and we cannot obviously explain it based on our preliminary data. However, abnormal OCT measures have also been found in other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and spinocerebellar ataxias, most likely related to the loss of retinal ganglion cells and axons.8 Therefore, further studies are required to establish whether OCT measures contribute for a sensitive and speciﬁc diagnosis of PD and to differentiate it from other conditions. We recognize our results cannot be compared with prior OCT reports in PD because of the different imaging map protocol and equipment. We are also aware that because of the small sample size used, these results need to be repeated in larger cohorts to ensure reproducibility.",0
"With regards to technical feasibility, the OCT compared with other expensive ones, such as the single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies using 123I-FP-CIT (DAT scan), is widely available, fast, as it only takes a few minutes to perform, and relatively inexpensive. Based on our preliminary data, and in accordance with other authors,2–5 we believe that foveal thickness measured by the OCT could be a promising, feasible biomarker of PD, by quantifying the morphological changes of retinal dopaminergic neurons.",0

"A large proportion of patients suffering from Parkinson’s disease presents with urinary dysfunction described as urgency, increased frequency or incontinence as predominant symptoms2,3 and also STN-DBS has proven to improve urinary function.4 Data from experimental urodynamic measures in men and animal models have demonstrated a signiﬁcant inﬂuence of STN-DBS on urinary bladder function.5,6 In these studies, the main effect of STN-DBS appeared to be a normalization of urodynamic parameters but there is no data reported about kidney function in these patients.7 Despite its clinical efﬁcacy, the manifold physiological consequences of STN-DBS are to date poorly understood.",0
"Acute renal failure (ARF) deﬁned as an abrupt or rapid decline in renal ﬁltration function and creatinine clearance (CC) is used to estimate the glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR). The CC test compares the level of creatinine in urine with the creatinine level in the blood, usually based on measurements of a 24-hour urine sample. GFR has never been studied in Parkinson patients with normal preoperative renal function immediately after STN-DBS. Here, we report a decline in renal ﬁltration function after STN-DBS.",0

"STN-DBS has been shown to ameliorate bladder dysfunction (increases bladder capacity) in patients with Parkinson’s disease, by modulation of sensory processing.9 It appears to be a normalization of urodynamic parameters, but there is no data reported about kidney function in these patients.",0
"In our patients kidney function was altered immediately after surgery. A decline in ﬁltration function developed after STN-DBS and some patients without preoperative RI developed acute RI postoperatively. In these patients no urinary retention occurred, urinary volume was similar before and after surgery. No preoperative hemodynamic complications, as dehydration occurred; like other series, neurostimulator implantation anesthetic technique is not associated with major hemodynamic adverse effects.10",0
"A recent study of experimentally induced ARF showed that there is a close interaction between the kidney and the central nervous system.11 Sympathetic inﬂuence in kidney functions is under control of brainstem biogenic amine cell groups and hypothalamic nuclei.12,13 It cannot be excluded that there may be regional effects of DBS-STN on hypothalamic centers, depending on the exact location of the contacts in the STN area.",0
"Effect of DBS-STN in hypothalamic centers remains a valid hypothesis which could explain an altered kidney function immediately after surgery, but further investigations are required to explore this possible mechanism.

"Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is one of the earliest nonmotor symptoms of Idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD).1 Hyposmia in PD is generally bilateral and remains unaffected by parkinsonian medication.1 Despite of its high occurrence, little is really known about the mechanisms of olfactory loss.2 Most hypotheses raised to explain this phenomenon involve neurodegenerative processes of olfactory structures.3 The authors report a case and the ﬂuorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET ﬁndings of a patient who underwent bilateral deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) and subsequently developed a great improvement in motor symptoms paralleled by an impressive recovery of olfaction after surgery.",0
"A 51-year-old man with advanced PD, severe motor ﬂuctuations, and incapacitating levodopa-induced dyskinesias underwent bilateral STN-DBS. He presented early onset of PD symptoms (35 years-old). Eight years ago, he started complaining of severe loss of olfaction discrimination (he seldom perceived very intense and unpleasant fragrances) and loss of libido. His motor scores on the UPDRS part III in ON medication were 35 and 74 in OFF medication condition. Chronic monopolar stimulation was applied on the contacts corresponding to the STN (two distal contacts on each side as the cathodes—1.7 V (right), 2.0 V (left), pulse width 210 ls, and frequency of 130 Hz). At ﬁve months on postoperative follow-up, the patient had experienced improvement in the UPDRS part III score (16 ONmed/ONstim vs. 39 OFFmed/ONstim). During a routine visit, the patient spontaneously reported marked improvement in his olfactory function. Olfaction was assessed using the brief smell identiﬁcation test (12-items, B-SIT).4 He recognized the odor of eight of twelve substances, score considered normal olfaction for someone his age, according to the Doty’s values.1",0

"tion to one of the substances (B-SIT). The second PET study was performed under the same conditions, but the stimulator had been turned off for seven days. At this time, the patient experienced return of hyposmia, as he observed and reported spontaneously. The OD at this point corresponded to the identiﬁcation of 2/12 fragrances in B-SIT. The results of PET images revealed signiﬁcant metabolic activation of thalamus, striatum, nucleus accumbens, and amygdaloid complex bilaterally as well as the left gyrus rectus. The tissue around the electrode also revealed metabolic activation, from deep STN extending to ventral thalamus (Fig. 1).",0
"Previous reports have stated that odor discrimination improves after STN-DBS in PD patients, while olfactory detection threshold does not. These results suggest that STNDBS might modulate cognitive processing of olfactory information.5 The return to hyposmia after the stimulation was turned off, favors the hypothesis that functional changes in striatum-thalamus-cortical networks, rather than irreversible degeneration of olfactory structures only, are responsible for OD observed in PD patients. The progressive neuronal loss throughout the brain generates dysfunction in the chronometry of circuits of the basal ganglia affecting different systems interpreted clinically as various symptoms of PD. Once the hyper activation of STN is reversed by the onset of local electrical stimulation, its inﬂuence spreads out to other neural circuits correcting dysfunctions of modulatory neurotransmitters, which in turn is related to the temporary improvement of motor and nonmotor symptoms. Although data in previous studies6 suggest that the motor effect obtained by dopaminergic medication and by STN stimulation shares the same activated brain areas, this is not likely to happen with olfactory function because dopaminergic reposition has no effect on hyposmia.1",0
"In line with previous reports, PET signs of motor improvement, attenuation of the Parkinson disease related pattern (PDRP)6 was expressed, except for a residual hypermetabolism in left striatum observed in the present study. Although a remarkable motor improvement was observed in this patient, the expected abolition of PDRP was not fully",0
"expressed. This apparent inconsistency may be related to individual variability in a single subject analysis or it may suggest the participation of left striatum in the olfactory information-processing network in this patient. Also, a substantial increase in metabolism in the vicinity of the subthalamic target site extending rostrally into the ventral thalamus was observed. Since the FDG hypermetabolism was highly coincident with the location of electrodes, this component is probably related to the direct effects of electrical stimulation of STN, inhibiting depolarization on the cell membrane.6 The electrode trajectory performed in this patient includes the motor anterior ventralis oralis nucleus of thalamus/posterior ventralis oralis nucleus of thalamus (VoA/VoP), as observed in the postoperative MRI, the upper contact is located within the ventral portion of thalamus. Besides the activation of amygdaloid complex, hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, thalamus, midbrain, and cerebellum related to olfactory stimulation in PD patients, as shown by Westermann et al.,7 also observed in this case, there was additional activation of bilateral nucleus accumbens and left gyrus rectus. Although further studies are required for more robust conclusions, the present ﬁndings suggest that the activated areas may mediate the odor discrimination improvement after bilateral STN-DBS. The stimulation of thalamic region in this case might also have activated thalamic nuclei related to olfactory function [e.g., nucleus parataenialis of thalamus (Pt)]. The connections of the Pt nucleus arise from the secondary olfactory centers through stria medullaris of thalamus.8 The activation of this nucleus could inﬂuence the olfactory circuitry at distant sites once reports of olfactory sensation were observed by direct electrical stimulation of this region.9",0
"These preliminary observations suggest that OD in PD may rather be a circuitry dysfunction and not only a neurodegenerative process in olfactory structures; a dysfunction of cognitive processing involved in odor discrimination might explain this phenomenon. There are multiple levels of integration of olfactory information and the STN-DBS seems to inﬂuence the circuit involving the primary olfactory areas, limbic areas as the ventral striatum and basal frontal cortex.

Familial Nonkinesigenic Paroxysmal Dyskinesia and Intracranial Calciﬁcations: A New Syndrome?,0
"Paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD) refers to a clinical syndrome characterized by attacks of involuntary movements, including dystonia, chorea, athetosis, or ballism, occurring at rest.1,2 PNKD is associated to a wide range of aetiologies, for example, autoimmune, vascular, traumatic, infective, and endocrine disorders.1 However, most cases of PNKD are idiopathic and neuroimaging is usually unremarkable.1,2 We report a PNKD family whose computed tomography (CT) scan revealed intracranial calciﬁcations.",0
"This four-generation family includes 5 (one deceased) patients (Table 1; Fig. 1). The proband (individual IV:2) is 7year-old girl who experienced at age of 9 months a ﬁrst attack of dystonic posture of the head with concomitant ballistic and choreic movements of upper and lower extremities. This event lasted 30 minutes, without alteration of consciousness, and was followed by prompt recovery. One month later, the girl experienced a similar episode precipitated by fever and resolving spontaneously. Neurological examination between attacks was normal. Laboratory investigations (serum and urine copper, calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, ceruloplasmin, ferritin, transferrin, serum iron, thyroid, parathyroid, and adrenocorticotropic hormones, anti-transglutaminase antibodies, serum lipoproteins and lipid proﬁle, lactate, pyruvate, amino acids, and urine organic acids) were normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was unremarkable.

Individual I:1 who experienced a single attack at age 75 years related to febrile illness, was considered as probably affected, considering the transitory nature of his manifestation and the fact that fever was a precipitating factor also in other affected members, as reported in PNKD.6 The course of the disease was relatively benign and affected individuals achieved spontaneous remission or continued to have about yearly episodes without treatment.

"Indeed, the most distinctive feature in our family was the ﬁnding of symmetrical intracranial calciﬁcations, primarily affecting the basal ganglia, which has been previously reported in few isolated cases.8–11 Hereditary brain calcinosis may be found in several different conditions,12 for example, disorders of parathyroid hormone or calcium regulation, mitochondrial diseases, and defects of organic or amino acid metabolism. However, all these aetiologies were ruled out in our family. Linkage to 14q, described in families with Fahr disease and neurological symptoms,5 was excluded, conﬁrming that this condition is genetically heterogeneous.13,14 Moreover, the pathogenetic role of calciﬁcations remains unclear as the youngest patient showed unremarkable neuroimaging despite full phenotypical presentation. Identiﬁcation of further families could shed light on the pathogenesis of PNKD.",0

These were partially suppressible but there was no clear urge to move. These movements worsened while on escitalopram, despite improvement of mood. No other exacerbating or alleviating factors were noted. His other subjective complaints were of mild worsening of balance, mild decreased dexterity manifest only while typing, and general fatigue. Past medical and social histories were unrevealing. The patient’s father is affected and is presented below.

TBZ withdrawal did not alter the balance complaint but did result in recrudescence of the same movements within 24 hours. The TBZ was reinstituted at the same dose without any other adverse events.",0

"Over the next 6 years, the dysphagia/dysarthria, gait, and cognition gradually progressed. At age 75, he was anarthric, unable to volitionally move the tongue despite lack of peripheral involvement per EMG, and wheelchair bound. Unrevealing evaluations were similar to Case 1 but also showed normal CSF studies, including a normal 14-3-3 protein, and a normal ataxia panel including dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy. MRI showed T2 lesions throughout the striatum and globus pallidus (Fig. 1). TBZ did help the chorea and stereotype but was poorly tolerated at higher doses due to sedation and parkinsonism.

The family denies any known ancestry from that area. On examination, the father appears to have a ‘‘classic’’ phenotype of chorea, prominently in the lower face, with later onset of gait disorder and dementia. However, we feel that the phenomenology of the son is best described as tics, or possibly stereotype, potentially expanding the phenotype of neuroferritinopathy.

"The index patient (Patient 1) underwent uncomplicated surgery of a right-sided carpal tunnel syndrome at 32 years of age. Two weeks later, she developed complex regional pain syndrome of the operated limb with severe pain and allodynia. Another two weeks later, dystonic posturing of the right hand with rapid jerky wrist and ﬁnger movements manifested. These jerks consisted of a complex mixture of phasic dystonic wrist ﬂexions and small amplitude ﬁnger movements (polymini-myoclonus). In addition, continuous jerky movements of her feet at rest were observed (Supporting Information Video, Segment 1), which were presumably preexisting but unrecognized by the patient herself. These movements were unpatterned and similar to limb movements seen in patients with benign hereditary chorea.1,4 EEG and SEP recordings showed no cortical correlates of the limb jerks but temporo-parietal focal slowing and intermittent temporal sharp-slow waves. As the forceful wrist and ﬁnger movements triggered pain attacks, injections to wrist and ﬁnger extensors and ﬂexors were given with a total dose of 800 U botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNTA); (Dysport, Ipsen Pharma).",1
"Injections dramatically reduced movement-induced pain attacks and were repeated every 3-month since then (Supporting Information Video, Segment 2). Severe depression with recurrent anxiety attacks necessitated admission to the local psychiatric hospital. Secondary generalized seizures and premature amenorrhoea started at the age of 33 years. Comprehensive neuropsychological testing revealed below-average cognitive capacities. At the age of 35 years, she started to develop sensory neuropathy, mild external ophthalmoplegia, and subtle gait ataxia, yet without leading to incapacitations in daily life (Supporting Information Video, Segment 3) (for MRI images, see Fig. 1).",0
"Patient 2, the index patient’s sister, manifested with slowly progressive cognitive deﬁcits during primary school, leading to severe cognitive deﬁcits at the age of 40. At age 13 years, epileptic seizures, recurrent headaches, and mild personality changes started. The movement disorder was similar to her sister’s: action-triggered myoclonus started at the left arm at age 14 years and generalized afterwards, whereas dystonic ulnar deviation of the right hand with ﬂexion of the ﬁngers III–V was ﬁrst noticed at age 20 years. Since then, she also developed progressive cerebellar ataxia and became wheel-chair bound at the age of 31. At the last examination (age 40 years) incomplete chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO); (Supporting Information Video, Segment 5) and severe axonal sensorimotor neuropathy were detected.

Genotyping of intragenic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) rs2072267, rs2307433, rs2246900, rs2302084, and rs2307438 showed a homozygous ‘‘C-Insertion-G-C-G’’ haplotype, which is identical to the haplotype common in North European W748S mutation carriers6 and thus suggests a relation between an ancient founder from North Europe and these Sicilian patients.",0
"Our ﬁndings demonstrate that POLG mutations should be considered in the workup of progressive complex hyperkinetic movement disorders. As of yet, hyperkinetic movements like myoclonus and chorea have been mentioned in POLG patients mainly as part of a plethora of POLG-associated symptoms.2,3 As shown in Patient 1, complex hyperkinetic movements presenting with myoclonus, dystonia, and possibly also choreic elements may be the only feature seen for several years. This ﬁnding moreover demonstrates that not only apraxia of eye lid opening7 and dystonic toe curling,8 but also upper limb dystonia is part of the spectrum of POLG-associated dystonia.",1
"Interestingly, the disease course in Patient 1 shows that cerebellar ataxia, sensory neuropathy, and/or PEO are not necessarily presenting or early features of autosomal-recessive-POLG (AR-POLG) mutations. A family history with consanguineous marriage and/or recessive inheritance (like in our pedigree) or POLG-characteristic features in the disease course (like in Patient 1) may support the decision for POLG sequencing in undiagnosed patients with hyperkinetic movement disorders.

Experimental evidence from humans and monkeys shows that there are dopaminergic cells in the retina, including the amacrine subtype A18 with D1 and D2 receptors, and interplexiform cells.",0
"Postmortem studies have shown that PD eyes have lower dopamine content,1 compared with healthy controls. Likewise, a loss in the sensitivity to contrast and color vision, altered visual evoked potential, and electroretinographic measurements have been observed, indicating foveal retinal ganglion cells damage in PD.2",0
"Quantitative morphology of gross retinal histology in humans can be measured in vivo using time domain Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). In PD a thinning of the peripapillary retinal nerve ﬁber layer, which represents axons of the ganglion cells, and macula have been shown, supporting the hypothesis that dopaminergic deﬁcit in the retina can cause structural changes.2–5 However, the usefulness of measuring foveal thickness by OCT as a diagnostic tool to differentiate PD from other tremor disease, such as essential tremor (ET) remains unknown. Therefore, the main purpose of this pilot study was to measure foveal thickness in patients with PD, and to compare it against a normal population and patients with ET.",0
"We designed a cross-sectional pilot study that included a consecutive sample of outpatients diagnosed with idiopathic PD in accordance with the UK Parkinson’s Disease Society brain bank, and ET based on clinical criteria. Patients with any coexisting ocular disease were excluded. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the General Yagu¨e Hospital, Burgos (Spain), and all patients signed the informed consent before being enrolled. Control subjects were matched for age (6 5 years) and gender to PD patients. Demographic and PD/ET laterality data were collected. OCT was acquired through a dilated pupil by an experienced operator using the OCT3 (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, Calif), with axial resolution of < 10 lm. The macular thickness map analysis and the center foveal thickness was automatically determined by the OCT3 software.6 Images were considered to be of good quality if the signal-to-noise ratio was greater than 30dB or had more than 95% sweeps accepted.",0
"Data analysis was performed from an exploratory point of view using the statistical package SPSS program (SPSS 17; SPSS, Chicago). Only descriptive analysis was used, owing to the small sample size. Data were summarized as mean 6 Potential conﬂict of interest: Nothing to report. Published online 28 July 2010 in Wiley Online Library (wileyonlinelibrary.com). DOI: 10.1002/mds.23215 standard deviation, and median (range). To maintain independence of all observations, right eye [RE] versus left eye [LE] were analyzed for each patient.",0
"Fifty-two eyes from 9 patients with PD (5 men and 4 women) with a mean age of 64.1 + 12 years and disease duration of 8.4 6 1.9 years, 8 patients with ET (4 men and 4 women) with a mean age of 67.8 6 4.8 years and disease duration of 23.7 6 18.3 years, and 9 controls were included. The mean foveal thickness was thinner in the PD group compared with the ET group and controls (Table 1). For the PD and ET groups, the mean foveal thickness was also thinner in the contra lateral eye of the most affected side (Table 1).",0
"In this pilot study, based on the OCT imaging, the fovea was thinner in the PD group compared with the ET group and controls. Interestingly, whereas interocular macular symmetry has been found in the normal population,7 we found that the foveal thickness was asymmetric and thinner in the eye contralateral to the side more affected by tremor and parkinsonism in the ET and PD groups, respectively. Hajee et al, also found the correlation between thinning in the left and the right eye of the same was not perfect.7 Hence, this interocular foveal asymmetry should be considered in interpretation. Except that for ET, although mild tremor asymmetry has been documented as a fundamental characteristic of ET, there is no published information regarding foveal thickness in patients with ET. The similar asymmetry ﬁnding in ET is difﬁcult to understand, and we cannot obviously explain it based on our preliminary data. However, abnormal OCT measures have also been found in other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and spinocerebellar ataxias, most likely related to the loss of retinal ganglion cells and axons.8 Therefore, further studies are required to establish whether OCT measures contribute for a sensitive and speciﬁc diagnosis of PD and to differentiate it from other conditions. We recognize our results cannot be compared with prior OCT reports in PD because of the different imaging map protocol and equipment. We are also aware that because of the small sample size used, these results need to be repeated in larger cohorts to ensure reproducibility.",0
"With regards to technical feasibility, the OCT compared with other expensive ones, such as the single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies using 123I-FP-CIT (DAT scan), is widely available, fast, as it only takes a few minutes to perform, and relatively inexpensive. Based on our preliminary data, and in accordance with other authors,2–5 we believe that foveal thickness measured by the OCT could be a promising, feasible biomarker of PD, by quantifying the morphological changes of retinal dopaminergic neurons.",0

"STN-DBS has been shown to ameliorate bladder dysfunction (increases bladder capacity) in patients with Parkinson’s disease, by modulation of sensory processing.9 It appears to be a normalization of urodynamic parameters, but there is no data reported about kidney function in these patients.",0
"In our patients kidney function was altered immediately after surgery. A decline in ﬁltration function developed after STN-DBS and some patients without preoperative RI developed acute RI postoperatively. In these patients no urinary retention occurred, urinary volume was similar before and after surgery. No preoperative hemodynamic complications, as dehydration occurred; like other series, neurostimulator implantation anesthetic technique is not associated with major hemodynamic adverse effects.10",0
"A recent study of experimentally induced ARF showed that there is a close interaction between the kidney and the central nervous system.11 Sympathetic inﬂuence in kidney functions is under control of brainstem biogenic amine cell groups and hypothalamic nuclei.12,13 It cannot be excluded that there may be regional effects of DBS-STN on hypothalamic centers, depending on the exact location of the contacts in the STN area.",0
"Effect of DBS-STN in hypothalamic centers remains a valid hypothesis which could explain an altered kidney function immediately after surgery, but further investigations are required to explore this possible mechanism.

"Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is one of the earliest nonmotor symptoms of Idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD).1 Hyposmia in PD is generally bilateral and remains unaffected by parkinsonian medication.1 Despite of its high occurrence, little is really known about the mechanisms of olfactory loss.2 Most hypotheses raised to explain this phenomenon involve neurodegenerative processes of olfactory structures.3 The authors report a case and the ﬂuorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET ﬁndings of a patient who underwent bilateral deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) and subsequently developed a great improvement in motor symptoms paralleled by an impressive recovery of olfaction after surgery.",0
"A 51-year-old man with advanced PD, severe motor ﬂuctuations, and incapacitating levodopa-induced dyskinesias underwent bilateral STN-DBS. He presented early onset of PD symptoms (35 years-old). Eight years ago, he started complaining of severe loss of olfaction discrimination (he seldom perceived very intense and unpleasant fragrances) and loss of libido. His motor scores on the UPDRS part III in ON medication were 35 and 74 in OFF medication condition. Chronic monopolar stimulation was applied on the contacts corresponding to the STN (two distal contacts on each side as the cathodes—1.7 V (right), 2.0 V (left), pulse width 210 ls, and frequency of 130 Hz). At ﬁve months on postoperative follow-up, the patient had experienced improvement in the UPDRS part III score (16 ONmed/ONstim vs. 39 OFFmed/ONstim). During a routine visit, the patient spontaneously reported marked improvement in his olfactory function.

Images corresponding to ‘‘on’’ and ‘‘off’’ conditions were compared through computerized voxel-based image subtraction (Matlab1/ImageJ1), fused onto the MRI (Osirix1) and plotted into the Tailarach atlas (Brainsight1).

"tion to one of the substances (B-SIT). The second PET study was performed under the same conditions, but the stimulator had been turned off for seven days. At this time, the patient experienced return of hyposmia, as he observed and reported spontaneously. The OD at this point corresponded to the identiﬁcation of 2/12 fragrances in B-SIT. The results of PET images revealed signiﬁcant metabolic activation of thalamus, striatum, nucleus accumbens, and amygdaloid complex bilaterally as well as the left gyrus rectus. The tissue around the electrode also revealed metabolic activation, from deep STN extending to ventral thalamus (Fig. 1).",0
"Previous reports have stated that odor discrimination improves after STN-DBS in PD patients, while olfactory detection threshold does not. These results suggest that STNDBS might modulate cognitive processing of olfactory information.5 The return to hyposmia after the stimulation was turned off, favors the hypothesis that functional changes in striatum-thalamus-cortical networks, rather than irreversible degeneration of olfactory structures only, are responsible for OD observed in PD patients. The progressive neuronal loss throughout the brain generates dysfunction in the chronometry of circuits of the basal ganglia affecting different systems interpreted clinically as various symptoms of PD. Once the hyper activation of STN is reversed by the onset of local electrical stimulation, its inﬂuence spreads out to other neural circuits correcting dysfunctions of modulatory neurotransmitters, which in turn is related to the temporary improvement of motor and nonmotor symptoms. Although data in previous studies6 suggest that the motor effect obtained by dopaminergic medication and by STN stimulation shares the same activated brain areas, this is not likely to happen with olfactory function because dopaminergic reposition has no effect on hyposmia.1",0
"In line with previous reports, PET signs of motor improvement, attenuation of the Parkinson disease related pattern (PDRP)6 was expressed, except for a residual hypermetabolism in left striatum observed in the present study. Although a remarkable motor improvement was observed in this patient, the expected abolition of PDRP was not fully",0
"expressed. This apparent inconsistency may be related to individual variability in a single subject analysis or it may suggest the participation of left striatum in the olfactory information-processing network in this patient. Also, a substantial increase in metabolism in the vicinity of the subthalamic target site extending rostrally into the ventral thalamus was observed. Since the FDG hypermetabolism was highly coincident with the location of electrodes, this component is probably related to the direct effects of electrical stimulation of STN, inhibiting depolarization on the cell membrane.6 The electrode trajectory performed in this patient includes the motor anterior ventralis oralis nucleus of thalamus/posterior ventralis oralis nucleus of thalamus (VoA/VoP), as observed in the postoperative MRI, the upper contact is located within the ventral portion of thalamus. Besides the activation of amygdaloid complex, hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, thalamus, midbrain, and cerebellum related to olfactory stimulation in PD patients, as shown by Westermann et al.,7 also observed in this case, there was additional activation of bilateral nucleus accumbens and left gyrus rectus. Although further studies are required for more robust conclusions, the present ﬁndings suggest that the activated areas may mediate the odor discrimination improvement after bilateral STN-DBS. The stimulation of thalamic region in this case might also have activated thalamic nuclei related to olfactory function [e.g., nucleus parataenialis of thalamus (Pt)]. The connections of the Pt nucleus arise from the secondary olfactory centers through stria medullaris of thalamus.8 The activation of this nucleus could inﬂuence the olfactory circuitry at distant sites once reports of olfactory sensation were observed by direct electrical stimulation of this region.9",0
"These preliminary observations suggest that OD in PD may rather be a circuitry dysfunction and not only a neurodegenerative process in olfactory structures; a dysfunction of cognitive processing involved in odor discrimination might explain this phenomenon. There are multiple levels of integration of olfactory information and the STN-DBS seems to inﬂuence the circuit involving the primary olfactory areas, limbic areas as the ventral striatum and basal frontal cortex.

Familial Nonkinesigenic Paroxysmal Dyskinesia and Intracranial Calciﬁcations: A New Syndrome?,0
"Paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD) refers to a clinical syndrome characterized by attacks of involuntary movements, including dystonia, chorea, athetosis, or ballism, occurring at rest.1,2 PNKD is associated to a wide range of aetiologies, for example, autoimmune, vascular, traumatic, infective, and endocrine disorders.1 However, most cases of PNKD are idiopathic and neuroimaging is usually unremarkable.1,2 We report a PNKD family whose computed tomography (CT) scan revealed intracranial calciﬁcations.",0
"This four-generation family includes 5 (one deceased) patients (Table 1; Fig. 1). The proband (individual IV:2) is 7year-old girl who experienced at age of 9 months a ﬁrst attack of dystonic posture of the head with concomitant ballistic and choreic movements of upper and lower extremities. This event lasted 30 minutes, without alteration of consciousness, and was followed by prompt recovery. One month later, the girl experienced a similar episode precipitated by fever and resolving spontaneously. Neurological examination between attacks was normal. Laboratory investigations (serum and urine copper, calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, ceruloplasmin, ferritin, transferrin, serum iron, thyroid, parathyroid, and adrenocorticotropic hormones, anti-transglutaminase antibodies, serum lipoproteins and lipid proﬁle, lactate, pyruvate, amino acids, and urine organic acids) were normal.

"This family shows typical clinical features of PNKD.1,2 All patients showed a typical pattern and duration of the episodes, not activated by movement, and showed normal neurological status between attacks except for the oldest living individual (II:3) who developed late-onset postural and kinetic tremor, responding to alcohol intake. Individual I:1 who experienced a single attack at age 75 years related to febrile illness, was considered as probably affected, considering the transitory nature of his manifestation and the fact that fever was a precipitating factor also in other affected members, as reported in PNKD.6 The course of the disease was relatively benign and affected individuals achieved spontaneous remission or continued to have about yearly episodes without treatment.

"Indeed, the most distinctive feature in our family was the ﬁnding of symmetrical intracranial calciﬁcations, primarily affecting the basal ganglia, which has been previously reported in few isolated cases.8–11 Hereditary brain calcinosis may be found in several different conditions,12 for example, disorders of parathyroid hormone or calcium regulation, mitochondrial diseases, and defects of organic or amino acid metabolism. However, all these aetiologies were ruled out in our family. Linkage to 14q, described in families with Fahr disease and neurological symptoms,5 was excluded, conﬁrming that this condition is genetically heterogeneous.13,14 Moreover, the pathogenetic role of calciﬁcations remains unclear as the youngest patient showed unremarkable neuroimaging despite full phenotypical presentation. Identiﬁcation of further families could shed light on the pathogenesis of PNKD.",0

"The index patient (Patient 1) underwent uncomplicated surgery of a right-sided carpal tunnel syndrome at 32 years of age. Two weeks later, she developed complex regional pain syndrome of the operated limb with severe pain and allodynia. Another two weeks later, dystonic posturing of the right hand with rapid jerky wrist and ﬁnger movements manifested. These jerks consisted of a complex mixture of phasic dystonic wrist ﬂexions and small amplitude ﬁnger movements (polymini-myoclonus). In addition, continuous jerky movements of her feet at rest were observed (Supporting Information Video, Segment 1), which were presumably preexisting but unrecognized by the patient herself. These movements were unpatterned and similar to limb movements seen in patients with benign hereditary chorea.1,4 EEG and SEP recordings showed no cortical correlates of the limb jerks but temporo-parietal focal slowing and intermittent temporal sharp-slow waves. As the forceful wrist and ﬁnger movements triggered pain attacks, injections to wrist and ﬁnger extensors and ﬂexors were given with a total dose of 800 U botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNTA); (Dysport, Ipsen Pharma).",1
"Injections dramatically reduced movement-induced pain attacks and were repeated every 3-month since then (Supporting Information Video, Segment 2). Severe depression with recurrent anxiety attacks necessitated admission to the local psychiatric hospital. Secondary generalized seizures and premature amenorrhoea started at the age of 33 years. Comprehensive neuropsychological testing revealed below-average cognitive capacities. At the age of 35 years, she started to develop sensory neuropathy, mild external ophthalmoplegia, and subtle gait ataxia, yet without leading to incapacitations in daily life (Supporting Information Video, Segment 3) (for MRI images, see Fig. 1).",1
"Patient 2, the index patient’s sister, manifested with slowly progressive cognitive deﬁcits during primary school, leading to severe cognitive deﬁcits at the age of 40. At age 13 years, epileptic seizures, recurrent headaches, and mild personality changes started. The movement disorder was similar to her sister’s: action-triggered myoclonus started at the left arm at age 14 years and generalized afterwards, whereas dystonic ulnar deviation of the right hand with ﬂexion of the ﬁngers III–V was ﬁrst noticed at age 20 years. Since then, she also developed progressive cerebellar ataxia and became wheel-chair bound at the age of 31. At the last examination (age 40 years) incomplete chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO); (Supporting Information Video, Segment 5) and severe axonal sensorimotor neuropathy were detected. As her phenotype suggested mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndrome (MIRAS),6",1
"Movement Disorders, Vol. 25, No. 14, 2010 2474 LETTERS TO THE EDITOR genetic analysis of the POLG gene was initiated, revealing a homozygous W748S mutation in both patients. Genotyping of intragenic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) rs2072267, rs2307433, rs2246900, rs2302084, and rs2307438 showed a homozygous ‘‘C-Insertion-G-C-G’’ haplotype, which is identical to the haplotype common in North European W748S mutation carriers6 and thus suggests a relation between an ancient founder from North Europe and these Sicilian patients.",1
"Our ﬁndings demonstrate that POLG mutations should be considered in the workup of progressive complex hyperkinetic movement disorders. As of yet, hyperkinetic movements like myoclonus and chorea have been mentioned in POLG patients mainly as part of a plethora of POLG-associated symptoms.2,3 As shown in Patient 1, complex hyperkinetic movements presenting with myoclonus, dystonia, and possibly also choreic elements may be the only feature seen for several years. This ﬁnding moreover demonstrates that not only apraxia of eye lid opening7 and dystonic toe curling,8 but also upper limb dystonia is part of the spectrum of POLG-associated dystonia.",1
"Interestingly, the disease course in Patient 1 shows that cerebellar ataxia, sensory neuropathy, and/or PEO are not necessarily presenting or early features of autosomal-recessive-POLG (AR-POLG) mutations. A family history with consanguineous marriage and/or recessive inheritance (like in our pedigree) or POLG-characteristic features in the disease course (like in Patient 1) may support the decision for POLG sequencing in undiagnosed patients with hyperkinetic movement disorders. Legends to the Video Patient 1",0
"Segment 1. At the age of 33 years, Patient 1 showed dystonia of both arms, with predominant dystonic ulnar deviation of the right upper limb with jerky wrist and ﬁnger movements, which had started four weeks after carpal tunnel surgery induced CRPS. Distal ﬁnger movements have smaller amplitudes characteristic of polymini-myoclonus. Also her feet show unpatterend jerky movements, which may be classiﬁed as myoclonus but are also similar to limb movements in benign hereditary chorea.1,4",1
"Segment 2. Botulinum toxin treatment of extensor and ﬂexor muscles of the right forearm markedly reduced hyperkinetic movements. The main therapeutic goal remained pain reduction. Apart from the botulinum toxin effect, also intermittent mirror movements can be observed in this segment. Segment 3. At the age of 35 years, external ophthalmoplegia, slowing of voluntary saccades and gait ataxia started. Also, a reduced arm swing on the right side was ﬁrst noticed. Patient 2",0
"Segment 4. At the age of 40 years, Patient 2 displayed dystonic ulnar deviation of the left upper limb with distal predominance. She showed intermittent facial and jaw opening dystonia. At rest, she had marked postural instability caused by trunk ataxia, which is aggravated by motor actions like e.g. lifting the upper limbs. Segment 5. In Patient 2 severe dysarthria, incomplete horizontal and vertical external ophthalmoplegia and ataxia were observed as clinical features of MIRAS. Patient 2 was only able to stand assisted for a few seconds.",1

"The atypical antipsychotic drug aripiprazole is a partial dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonist and an antagonist at serotonin 5-HT2A receptors. It is a promising agent for patients with schizophrenia but also for those with Huntington’s disease (HD), who may suffer from psychosis, aggression, cognitive decline, and movement disorder. Recent reports1,2 and clinical observations suggest that aripiprazole improves chorea and functional disability with an effect comparable with tetrabenazine but with less sedation and better tolerability. Thus, aripiprazole may be an attractive treatment option in HD, in particular for patients with psychosis and chorea or those not responding to other chorea treatments. In schizophrenia, however, aripiprazole was associated with neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).3,4 Patients with HD may have an increased risk for developing NMS although the occurrence of NMS in HD is rarely reported.5 Here, we present a case of MNS in a HD patient treated with aripiprazole.",0
"The patient, a 55-year-old retired engineering technician, presented with increasingly severe behavioral disorders including irritability and violent behavior. Unequivocal motor signs of HD (chorea) had been observed for the ﬁrst time 10 years before. The father and brother of the patients had died of HD. The clinical diagnosis of HD was conﬁrmed with molecular genetic testing (CAG repeat expansion with 43 triplets). An MRI scan of the brain at the time of diagnosis showed normal cerebral morphology. Recent MRI scans revealed HD typical morphological alterations (symmetric atrophy of the striatum and widening of the lateral ventricles). Subsequently, the patient developed severe chorea of arms and legs, head and trunk together with moderate cognitive",0

On admission, he presented with severe dysarthria, generalized chorea, slowing of saccadic eye movements, severely unsteady gait and postural instability. Cognitive deﬁcits comprised several domains including attention, memory, and executive functions.",0
"Initially, the patient had been treated for chorea with perphenazine and tiapride; because of increasingly aggressive behavior, risperidone was initiated and considered effective over 4 years. Sertraline was added to treat depressive symptoms. Upon admission, the patient was treated with risperidone (3 mg/d), sertraline (50 mg/d), and tiapride (700 mg/d). Trimipramine (50 mg) and melperone (50 mg) had been tried unsuccessfully to ameliorate insomnia. We considered a connection between risperidone and aggravated agitation and restlessness in terms of an extrapyramidal side effect. Withdrawing risperidone, we added aripiprazole (10 mg) to tiapride and melperone to treat the patient’s aggressive behavior because aripiprazole is known to reduce aggressive symptoms in other psychiatric disorders.6 Within 2 days, the patient attracted attention because of apathy, muscular rigidity, and fever together with tachycardia and tachypnea.

Upon immediate withdrawal of all dopamine antagonists (tiapride, melperone, aripiprazole), parenteral hydration and treatment with diuretics, clinical symptoms, and laboratory abnormalities resolved within 2 weeks. Because of recurrent symptoms of chorea, irritability, and disturbed sleep, we initiated tetrabenazine (up to 112.5 mg) and quetiapine (50 mg) together with sertraline (150 mg) and mirtazapine (45 mg), resulting in adequate symptom control without recurrence of NMS.",0
"To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report of NMS in HD with aripiprazole treatment. The application of conventional clinical doses of aripiprazole, such as in our case, leads to a nearly complete saturation of D2-like dopamine receptors.7 High dopamine D2 receptor afﬁnity has been suggested as one of the bases of NMS, particularly of note when adding aripiprazole to other dopamine-receptor antagonists3 as in our case. Blocking striatal and hypothalamic dopamine transmission may have contributed to muscular rigidity and dysfunctional thermoregulation.7 Although a polypharmacologic cause of NMS has to be considered in our patient, the proportionally low afﬁnity of tiapride and melperone to D2-like dopamine receptors suggests that aripiprazole may have been the main culprit. In conclusion, when using aripiprazole in HD one needs to be aware of the risk for NMS, in particular, if patients take other dopamine-receptor antagonists.",0

Results Histochemical analysis of a muscle biopsy specimen showed numerous cytochrome c oxidase–deficient fibers. Molecular analysis revealed marked depletion of muscle mitochondrial DNA in the absence of multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions. Sequence analysis of the POLG gene revealed heterozygous sequence variants in compound c.1156C>T (p.R386C) and c.2794C>T (p.H932Y) segregating with clinical disease in the family. The p.R386C change appears to be a novel mutation.,1

Report of a case Case,0
"A 27-year-old man born to nonconsanguineous parents presented with a 3-year history of progressive weakness of the distal upper limbs in the absence of sensory disturbances. He used to be an amateur tennis player but had to stop this activity on account of his reduced muscle strength. He reported normal motor development and there was no family history suggestive of neuromuscular disease. Clinical examination showed asymmetric, moderate weakness of wrist extension (Medical Research Council Scale score 3/5 on the right side and 4/5 on the left) and elbow flexion and finger extension (Medical Research Council Scale score 4/5). There was no muscle atrophy. Deep tendon reflexes were reduced in the upper extremities, corresponding with strength reduction. Muscle strength of the lower extremities was normal, and he had no evidence of ptosis or external ophthalmoplegia. His creatine kinase level was mildly increased (396 U/L; reference range, 22-269 U/L [to convert to microkatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167]), whereas his serum lactate level was normal (17.02 mg/dL; reference range, 4.5-20 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.111]). Radial, ulnar, and posterior tibialis nerve conduction studies were performed to rule out motor neuropathies and results were repeatedly normal. Electromyography consistently showed myopathic features characterized by early interference pattern and small polyphasic motor unit potentials in the biceps brachii, wrist extensors, and finger extensors bilaterally, although no electromyography abnormalities were observed in the trunk or lower limb muscles. Renal and hepatic profiles and thyroid, pancreatic, and cardiac function were all unremarkable. He subsequently underwent an open biopsy of the deltoid muscle for diagnostic purposes.",1
Analysis,0
"Standard histological and histochemical analyses were performed on fresh frozen muscle sections (10 μm). Total DNA was extracted from blood and whole-muscle homogenates by standard procedures. Single cytochrome c oxidase (COX)–positive and COX-deficient skeletal muscle cells were separately obtained by laser-capturing microdissection with the MMI UV-CUT System (Nikon Instruments, Kingston, England).4 The total amount of mtDNA was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, as previously described.5 Briefly, an mtDNA fragment (nucleotide 4625-4714) and a nuclear DNA fragment (FasL gene) were coamplified using a multiplex TaqMan polymerase chain reaction assay (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Parsley, England). For each assay, a standard curve for mtDNA and nuclear DNA was generated using serial dilutions of a vector (kind gift from Andrea Cossarizza, MD, PhD) in which the regions used as the template for the 2 amplifications were cloned tail to tail to have a ratio of 1:1 of the reference molecules. The absolute mtDNA copy number per nucleus was obtained by multiplying the ratio of mtDNA to nuclear DNA values by 2 (because 2 copies of the nuclear gene are present in a cell). Screening for mtDNA large-scale rearrangements was carried out by real-time polymerase chain reaction6 and conventional polymerase chain reaction using shifted primer sets within the major arc of human mtDNA7 both on muscle homogenate DNA and on microdissected cells. The entire coding region and intron-exon boundaries of POLG were amplified and directly sequenced as previously reported.1",0

"© 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Introduction The POLG1 gene mutation is a commonly reported gene defect identiﬁed in autosomal recessive mitochondrial DNA depletion disorders [1]. POLG1 gene, located on chromosome 15q25, encodes for the 140-kDa catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase γ, which is responsible for mitochondrial DNA replication [1]. DNA polymerase γ also consists of a",0
"55-kDa accessory subunit, which is encoded by the POLG2 gene on chromosome 17q23–24, and is responsible for tight binding to doublestranded DNA [2]. The POLG1 gene mutation was identiﬁed as a genetic substrate in Alpers’ disease [3], which was described in the early 1930s by Bernard Alpers as diffuse progressive degeneration of the gray matter in children [4]. Since that time many more POLG1 genotypes causing Alpers’ disease have been discovered [5]. More than 150 different homozygous and heterozygous POLG1 mutations have been reported in the literature [2,4,6–8]. They have variable phenotypes, clinical spectra, and natural histories, which depend on the speciﬁc POLG1 gene mutation. Mitochondrial disorders can have a very insidious clinical course, which can make the diagnosis difﬁcult, especially if the genetic workup for routinely tested mitochondrial disorders is negative. Treatment of epilepsy in patients with POLG1 gene mutations, speciﬁcally the compound heterozygous A467T/W748S genotype, is very challenging, and the epilepsy may selectively respond to only certain antiepileptic drugs [7].",0

"A 16-year-old right-handed woman, who was an ex-preemie (gestational age=36 weeks) born to nonconsanguineous parents, developed over a 1-year period progressively worsening focal seizures refractory to multiple antiepileptic drugs. The patient had daily seizures of different semiology, signifying the multifocality of her seizures. The ﬁrst was a focal motor seizure, with right face, arm, and leg twitching infrequently evolving into convulsions. The second type was a visual sensory seizure which was described as either a right homonymous hemianopsia or colored spheres in the right visual ﬁeld, and the third type of seizure was a somatosensory seizure of spreading numbness and tingling sensation on the right side of the body. She was refractory to oxcarbazepine, levetiracetam, and zonisamide, at which point topiramate was started but the patient developed cognitive side effects and, therefore, topiramate was discontinued. Valproic acid was initiated which made the patient's cognitive symptoms and seizures worse, at which time the patient was brought to Thomas Jefferson University epilepsy monitoring unit with focal status epilepticus for video/EEG (VEEG) monitoring.",1

"stantia nigra and no lesions or signs of demyelination elsewhere in the brain; thus, it was conﬁrmed that damage to the substantia nigra alone could produce clinical features of PD. Although several viruses are known to cause Parkinsonism,1 it is uncommon that a virus could have produced lesions predominantly in the substantia nigra and have caused reversible Parkinsonism. Such selective lesions have demonstrated with toxins such as 1-methyl-4-phenyl1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP).2 However, the current study demonstrates the capability of a virus to do so. Hsieh et al.3 reported the case of a boy who presented with reversible Parkinsonism as the major symptom of EBV encephalitis. Brain single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed diminished perfusion in the region of the right caudate nucleus and no abnormalities in substantia nigra. Roselli et al.4 also reported a case of reversible Parkinsonism associated with EBV encephalitis and antineuronal antibodies detected in a human neuroblastoma cell line, which suggests that an autoimmune mechanism may play an important pathophysiological role. However, MRI showed no abnormalities in substantia nigra in these 2 cases, which was different from our case. Our observation indicates a direct acute neurotropic effect of EBV on nigral dopaminergic cells. The patient showed a substantial response in the acute phase to dopaminergic medication. During the treatment, this patient did not develop L-dopa–related dyskinesias or wearing off. We will follow this patient to observe whether she develops PD later.",0

"Most published studies speciﬁcally investigated sporadic PD. In our study we showed the increased frequency of the L444P mutation in familial PD. The association of GBA variants with familial PD was also reported in the PROGENI study.5 It was established earlier that parkinsonism associated with a GBA mutation appears to phenotypically resemble sporadic PD, but an early disease onset was reported.1 In our study the frequency of the L444P mutation in patients with early-onset (::;50 years old) PD was the highest among the studied groups.",0

More recent studies have distanced these disorders from Gilles de la Tourette syndrome despite the publication of some cases with stimulusinduced tics5 and considered them to be factitious, psychogenic, or psychotic in origin.6 It was later proposed that there is a universal tendency to exaggerated startle in some individuals, which may be more or less exaggerated.7",0

"FOXG1 haploinsufﬁciency is a rare cause of complex developmental encephalopathy due to de novo intragenic mutations of the Forkhead box G1 (FOXG1) gene, large deletions encompassing the gene, or disruption of cis-regulatory elements.1 The typical FOXG1 syndrome, a key differential diagnosis of Rett syndrome, is one of early-onset severe encephalopathy with microcephaly, and hand and tongue stereotypies. Less than 10% of the FOXG1 patients are able to walk.1 Mixed hyperkinetic, early-onset, movement disorders are also a hallmark of the syndrome. They are characterized by various combinations of chorea, dystonia, and athetosis. Clinical spectrum and disease’s course in adulthood are poorly known.1–3",0
"A 38-year-old female had no familial history of neurologic or psychiatric disorder. Pregnancy, delivery, and perinatal period were normal. She had severe psychomotor retardation from age 3 months. Microcephaly was noted from age 11 months (-2 standard deviations [SD]) and gradually worsened. She walked at age 5 years and never acquired language. Social interactions were very poor. She had pharmacoresponsive epilepsy with tonic-clonic seizures and stereotypies since childhood. Around the age of 30 years, according to the mother, although the date of onset could not be veriﬁed, she developed dyskinetic movement disorders with gradual worsening of walking difﬁculties. At age 38, she was treated with valproate (for 20 years) and lamotrigine (for 2 years) for epilepsy. She had microcephaly (head circumference -3.5 SD), and convergent strabismus. She had stereotypies with frequent rubbing/twiddling hand movements and occasional episodes of trunk rocking (see Video). She also had generalized dystonia with predominant craniofacial involvement, athetoid movements of the 4 limbs, and akinetic-rigid parkinsonism without tremor (see Video). There was no manifestation of vegetative dysfunction. At the last follow-up at age 41 years, the patient could still walk unaided. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed simpliﬁed gyral pattern and reduced white matter volume (Fig. 1). Dopamine transporter imaging with 123I-FP-CIT (DaTSCAN) showed a moderate asymmetrical reduction in striatal uptake predominating in putamina. Array comparative genomic hybridization found no chromosomal abnormality and sequencing of the MECP2 gene was normal. Molecular studies identiﬁed a new mutation c.610C>T in",0

"The FOXG1 mutation was absent in her mother but its de novo origin could not be ascertained, because of the father’s death. However, its causative role is highly probable: (1) it lies in the functionally critical DNA-binding forkhead domain of the protein; (2) it involves a residue highly conserved in different species; and (3) it was never found in 200 control females.",0
"Four adult FOXG1 patients have been previously reported (aged 18–31 years).1–3 None of them had been able to walk and there is no detailed information on the characteristics and course of their movement disorders. Our patient is the oldest reported FOXG1 case, which conﬁrms that prolonged survival into adulthood is possible. She has original phenotypic characteristics: (1) she was able to walk, accounting for a rare ‘‘mild’’ phenotype of the disorder; (2) dystonia and athetoid movements started later in life than in other reported FOXG1 patients1–5; (3) she had late-onset a kinetic-rigid parkinsonism similar to what has been reported in patients with Rett syndrome.6 Antiepileptic drugs might have contributed to the movement disorders, but the absence of a temporal link between drugs intake and their development, and the DaTSCAN abnormalities do not favor this hypothesis. Although we cannot exclude a co-occurrence of early-onset Parkinson’s disease and FOXG1 syndrome, our ﬁndings, based on this single case, suggest that dysfunction of the nigrostriatal pathway can result from FOXG1 mutations. A similar alteration has been evidenced in RTT patients.7",0

"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletionsyndromes(MDDS; MIM* 251880), first described in 1991 by Moraes et al.1 are heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorders sharing marked reduction in mtDNA copy number in oneor more tissues. Generally, MDDS have an infantile or childhood onset with tissue specific features. The POLG1 gene (MIM*174763) is one of the several MDDS nuclear genes encoding proteins involved in the deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate metabolism and in mtDNA maintenance. Early onset usually presents either an infantile myocerebrohepatopathy spectrum (MCHS) or Alpers Syndrome (AS).2 An increasing number of POLG1 mutations have been reported as a cause of AS.2e11 Combined encephalopathy and liver failure with MDDS can also be due to mutations in other MDDS nuclear genes such as PEO1 (Twinkle; MIM* 60675), DGUOK (MIM*601465), MPV17 (MIM* 256810) and SUCLG112 (MIM* 245400).",0
"In this paper, we report the clinical, biochemical, radiological and neuropathological features of a 31/2 month-old patient with two different POLG mutations, who first met the diagnostic criteria for MCHS, subsequently for AS and then with Leigh syndromeneuropathologicalfeatures. Wecomparedtheclinical presentationwiththepresentationsofother MDDS nucleargene defects combining encephalopathy and liver failure and report the effects of dietary treatment onliver disease progression.

"The present patient was born at term after an uneventful pregnancy from healthy non-consanguineous parents. Birth weight was 2970 g and length 50 cm. By the age of 31/2 months, following an overnight fasting with mild febrile illness, she presented with hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, moderate ketosis and liver dysfunction. On admission, physical examination was normal except a liver edge palpable at 3 cm below the right costal margin and a generalized hypotonia with preserved deep tendon reflexes. Weight was 4560 g (<P10), length 59 cm (P25) and head circumference 38.5 cm (<P10). She developed progressive jaundice and abdominal distension with ascites and increased liver echogenicity at ultrasound. Plasma amino acid chromatography showed increased alanine (1326 mmol/l: normal 128e441) level. Isoelectrofocusing of serum sialotransferrins was normal. Alpha-foetoprotein levels were increased from 311 to 3870.0 ng/ml (normal: 0e15.0 ng/ml). Urinary adipic acid (2025 mmol/g creatinine; normal: 30e440) and hydroxydicarboxylic acids",1
"were increased. Urinary amino acids were normal. CSF analysis showed slight increased protein (0.5 g/l; normal < 0.4 g/l) and lactate (2.92 mmol/l; normal 1.20e2.10) levels. Table 1 shows laboratory data at different periods (at onset, after continuous IV glucose administration, nasogastric fractional meal supplemented with raw corn-starch, LCT and/or medium chain triglyceride (MCT) intake, following LCT restriction at days 55 and 63 after onset). Postprandial lactate was normal. In contrast, hypoglycemia and hyperlactacidemia were induced by fasting periods of 8 h and did not respond to IM glucagon. LCT restriction induced a decreased of abdominal distension and jaundice, associated with biochemical improvement of hepatocellular cytolysis and cholestasis. Later, alpha-foeto-protein levels also decreased to lower levels (35.2 ng/ml; normal: 0e15.0 ng/ml). At 18 months of age, she was able to walk by shuffling. She could speak approximately 20 words, combine two words together but not handle three word sentences. Few episodes of atypical absences followed by a drop attack were observed, but there was no psychomotor regression. Both EEG and brain MRI were normal. At the age of three years, her developmental quotient was 62 (Harvey test). A few months later she was admitted in status epilepticus with generalized tonico-clonic seizures. She had an intermittent tremor, moderate truncal ataxia with a wide-based gait. Between 4 and 49/12 years of age, she suffered 2 more episodes of status epilepticus requiring artificial ventilation and was treated with different anti-epileptic drugs except valproate. Developmental regression occurred with loss of walking ability and right-hand use. Additional seizure types appeared consisting of myoclonic seizures and epilepsia partialis continua. EEG disclosed spike-wave complexes and paroxysmal delta and sharp waves predominantly in the right and left occipital area. Sensory conduction velocity (SCV) was decreased (left median nerve: wrist: 25.3 m/s (normal range 48.6 ± 3.0), left superficial peroneal nerve: not obtained). Late MRI disclosed on T2 sequence, a high signal abnormality in the right inferior colliculus as shown in Fig. 1. At that time, the clinical diagnosis of AS was made, although the initial clinical feature was compatible with infantile MCHS. She died of respiratory insufficiency at the age of 5 years. Autopsy of both brain and medulla were performed.",1
"Investigations and results The oxidation of 14C1-octanoate (14C1e8), 14C1-palmitate (14C1e16) and 14C1-succinate (14C1e4) in fibroblasts was normal.

Activities of fructose 1phosphate aldolase (aldolase B), fructose-1, 6-biphosphatase and glucose-6phosphatase in liver tissue were normal. At 17 months of age, histopathological analysis of a muscle biopsy was normal (including the absence of ragged red fibres) as well as OXPHOS activities. The results of the second liver biopsy have been reported elsewhere13; most striking was a mosaic distribution of cytochrome oxidase activity as well as its immunolocalisation in liver mitochondria. Blue native-Page of liver tissue showed a decreased activity of complex IV. The amount of mtDNA was 21% in muscle, 27% in liver and 98% in blood.

"Microscopic examination of the brain revealed a widespread cortical necrosis in the right striate cortex (primary visual cortex) associated with capillary endothelial cell swelling, congestion and spongiosis involving layer II and IV with relative preservation of neurons (Fig. 2A). Reactive (gemistocytic) astrocytes were observed in the middle and deep cortical layers. Astrogliosis was also present in the superior frontal, cingulate, parahippocampal, occipitotemporal gyri. In the neostriatum (caudate nucleus and putamen) neuronal cell dropout, chromatolysis, fibrillary gliosis, and pallor within the neuropil were visualized. The hippocampus was well preserved as well as the parahippocampal gyrus. In the thalamus, only one area of the pars lateralis of the pulvinar showed a focal loss of large-size neurons associated with capillary endothelial cell swelling and congestion, vacuoles as well as astrogliosis. In the brainstem, the inferior colliculi displayed symmetric peculiar necrotizing lesions, capillary endothelial cell hypertrophy causing luminal narrowing and relative preservation of neurons with prominent Nissl endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 2B). In the mesencephalic reticular formation and the pars compacta of the substantia nigra, there was only spongiosis. The cerebellar cortex showed mild focal loss of Purkinje cells with pallor of the internal granular cell layer. The dentate nucleus showed neuronal depletion with vacuolization within the neuropil. In the spinal cord, myelin pallor, indicating fibre loss was observed in the posterior column as well as in the posterior spinocerebellar tract associated with mild astrogliosis. Also Clarke’s column showed neuronal loss, but anterior horn neurons and intermediolateral cell columns seemed preserved.",1
"Discussion At 31/2 months of age, the present patient presented an acute episode of fasting-induced hypoketotic hypoglycemia with hyperlactatemia and liver dysfunction. Plasma lactate reached its maximum levels when she was fasting and hypoglycemic as it can occur in gluconeogenesis disorders.14 In the present case, glucose-6-phosphatase and fructose-1, 6-biphosphatase european j o urnal o f p aediatric n euro logy 16 (2012) 542 e548 545 Fig. 2 e (A) Right area striata showing capillary endothelial cell swelling and congestion, astrocytic gliosis with",1

"activities were normal. The clinical triad of MCHS defined by hypotonia, developmental delay and hepatopathy was found in the present patient. Additional diagnostic findings such as elevated CSF lactate were found, and later, at the age of 18 months, an onset of seizures and at 41/2 years a decreased SCV. Also, the characteristic features of the first liver biopsy performed at 91/2 months of age did not meet the criteria for the diagnosis of AS.9 Of the 8 characteristic histological findings only micronodular cirrhosis and bile ductular proliferation were identified. Early dietary regimen initiated in the present patient with frequent nasogastric feeding and LCT restriction could have modified the fatty change like steatosis. Nevertheless after the age of 41/2 years, the clinical triad of AS was present with refractory mixed type seizures including a focal component, psychomotor regression (episodic) and hepatopathy with acute liver failure.9 Three other additional clinical or laboratory features for AS were found including elevated CSF protein, abnormal EEG with asymmetric and high amplitude slow wave activity intermixed with polyspike discharges and liver enzymatic respiratory chain defects. In liver tissue, only complex IV showed a decreased activity suggesting that in this",1
"case complex IV was the most vulnerable as seen in other MDDS.10 The finding of normal muscle histochemical and OXPHOS activities emphasised the need to investigate several primary tissues as muscle analysis in the present case, gave misleading results. In the present patient under IV glucose and frequent feedings with LCT, we found a severe hepatic dysfunction including cytolysis, cholestatic jaundice, ascites like in long chain 3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogensase (LCHAD), while MCT dietary fat had a beneficial effect. In LCHAD deficiency, liver cirrhotic changes are presumed to be a toxic effect of the accumulating 3-hydroxy fatty acids.15 In the same way, in children harbouring POLG mutations, valproic acid which is a branched chain carboxylic acid has been reported as very hepatotoxic in AS.16 In some of the MDDS patients, an elevation of AFP levels can be a helpful diagnostic clue. In the present patient, AFP levels were initially markedly increased and subsequently returned to lower values (35.2 ng/ ml; normal: 0e15.0 ng/ml). Increased serum AFP level has been reported in DGUOK deficiency17e20 and in MVP17 deficiency.21 The genotype of the present patient has been reported in AS. Most of AS affected patients carry the linker p.Ala467Thr mutation mostly associated with p.Trp748Ser another linker mutation or p.Gly848Ser mutation located in the polymerase domain.2,5,6,22 In most patients with features of AS, the most prominent symptom is intractable progressive epilepsy, while hepatopathy develops later in the course of the disease. The POLG1 gene (OMIM *174763) is one of the nine MDDS nuclear genes. Six of them (TK2,23,24 RRM2B,25 DGUOK,18 SUCLG1,",1
"SUCLA2,12,26,27 TYMP28) supply the mitochondria with nucleo-",0
"tide pools needed for DNA replication. POLG2 and Twinkle29 products function directly at the mtDNA replication fork. MPV1730 encodes an inner membrane mitochondrial protein of unknown function. Combined encephalopathy and liver failure can also be a feature of other MDDS nuclear genes such as Twinkle, DGUOK, MPV17 and SUCLG1 mutations. Patients with Twinkle mutation have liver insufficiency, major truncal hypotonia, seizures, peripheral sensitive neuropathy, growth retardation, abnormal eye movements and hyperlactatemia.29 In DGUOK deficiency,18 the majority of infants have cholestasis, subsequently neurologic dysfunction with severe hypotonia, developmental regression and nystagmus, but no seizures or EEG abnormalities. In MPV17 defects, the patients are characterized by a variable neurological involvement at onset, absent or mild hyperlactatemia, consistently severe hypoglycaemia 3e4 h after meals, no hyperlactatemia after glucose loading, and beneficial effect of IV glucose and frequent feeding on liver function tests.31 Mutations in SUCLG1 were found in a patient with both Leigh disease and recurrent hepatic failure but also severe myopathy.12",0
"Table 2 emphasizes the neuropathologic microscopic features of patients with AS or infantile hepatocerebral phenotype associated with POLG mutations in POLG1 gene reported in the literature and those of the index patient harbouring the p.Ala467Thr/p.Gly848Ser subtitutions.2,3,5,7,32e34",0
"Although the late clinical features of the present patient corresponded to AS, she particularly exhibited lesions in the dorsal part of the mid brain and to a lesser extent in the deep grey structures and spinal cord, which were strikingly reminiscent of those that occur in LS.

In Leigh syndrome, lesions tend to be symmetrical and",0
"predominate, as in the present patient, in the dorsal part of the brain stem, but also in the neostriatum, the cerebellar nuclei, the thalamus and the spinal cord.35 However in both thalami and substantia nigra such lesions were not observed in the index patient but for the lateral part of the pulvinar. In contrast in AS, selective involvement of the calcarine cortex european j o urnal o f p aediatric n euro logy 16 (2012) 542 e548 547",0
"with patchy neuronal loss and gliosis is typical, although all cortical areas may be affected. White matter changes are usually slight in both AS and Leigh’s encephalopathy, but may predominate (Table 2; reference 7, patient # 7). The lesions could correspond to energy imbalance in neurones or astrocytes in areas incongruent to a vascular territory or sulcal topography.36",0
"In conclusion, this case report particularly highlights the change from infantile MCHS to AS and the effects of dietary treatment in slowing the progression of liver failure. Therefore, we suggest to study the effect of LCT dietary restriction on liver function in other patients with AS or POLG associated hepatopathy. Finally, this report extends the neuropathological spectrum of AS to Leigh’s lesions.

"This 54 year old woman presented with symptoms of sensory ataxic neuropathy, with cerebellar features. She developed further weakness, visual disturbances with diplopia, dysarthria and dysphasia. After her death at 66 years, she was found to have compound heterozygous mutations of POLG1 gene in muscle, and Southern blot showed low levels of multiple deletions of mitochondrial DNA. Neuropathological examination showed profound dorsal column and dorsal spinocerebellar tract degeneration, degeneration of dorsal root ganglia and Clarke’s nucleus in spinal cord and severe predominantly sensory peripheral neuropathy.

Spinocerebellar ataxia tests for SCA1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 were all negative. Friedreich’s ataxia screen was negative. Serum vitamin E was within normal limits. ECG showed P-pulmonale and an ACE inhibitor was given. An echocardiogram showed no cardiomyopathy. Sleep studies revealed moderate sleep apnoea, but the patient did not tolerate CPAP. Brain MRI in 2007 revealed mild atrophy of the superior cerebellar vermis. A swallowing assessment revealed a delayed pharyngeal phase.",1

Further studies were carried out on two other siblings and the daughter with no manifestation of disease. Only the c.830A>T mutation was found in heterozygous form in the patient’s 36 year old daughter and the patient’s 72 year old sister. The two variants described in the patient were not detected in the second sibling of 80 years of age. Discussion,0
"This woman presented in middle age with a progressive sensory ataxic neuropathy with later development of ptosis, dysarthria, dysphagia and external ophthalmoparesis. No deﬁnite diagnosis was made prior to autopsy but a form of hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia with peripheral neuropathy was favoured. Mitochondrial cytopathy was suspected in view of the previous changes of “ragged-red” ﬁbres and cytochrome oxidase-negative ﬁbres on two muscle biopsies performed 20 and 14 years prior to death.",1
"Autopsy conﬁrmed that the patient had multiple mtDNA deletions associated with compound heterozygous POLG mutations (p.A862T and p.H277L) in skeletal muscle. The p.A862T mutation has been reported previously as a compound heterozygous mutation in a man with late onset PEO and ataxia with a SCA-like illness in siblings [8]. The p.H277L mutation has only been very recently reported as a compound heterozygous mutation in a man with late onset PEO and parkinsonism [9]. Detailed neuropathological examination in our case conﬁrmed features of mitochondrial myopathy in multiple skeletal muscles, severe predominantly sensory peripheral neuropathy, but also profound dorsal column and dorsal spinocerebellar tract degeneration in the spinal cord, which has not previously been reported in patients with documented POLG mutations or SANDO. Dorsal root ganglion cells were reduced in number and size with evidence of dropout and ongoing degeneration. Clarke’s nucleus also showed loss of large neurons and reduced size and numbers of residual neurons. However, spinal cord involvement (dorsal column and dorsal spinocerebellar tract degeneration) has been noted in patients with mitochondrial cytopathy with ataxic neuropathy and PEO [10]. Another adult case with multiple mtDNA deletions, published prior to the identiﬁcation of POLG [3], but who is likely to have POLG mutation(s) and the clinical scenario of ataxia, PEO, ptosis, peripheral neuropathy, dysphagia and extrapyramidal movement disorder also had dorsal column and dorsal root ganglia degeneration at autopsy [11]. Posterior column degeneration has been reported in a family with a rare autosomal dominant POLG1 mutation with metabolic strokes and multiendocrine disease [12].",1

Mutations in POLG account for one of the most frequent nuclear encoded causes of mitochondrial disorders to date. Individuals harboring POLG mutations exhibit fairly heterogeneous clinical presentations leading to increasing difﬁculties in classifying these patients into deﬁned clinical phenotypes. This study aims to investigate the molecular basis of a mitochondrial cytopathy in a patient with 3-methylglutaconic aciduria and to expand the clinical phenotype associated with POLG mutations.,0
"Clinical, molecular and genetic analyses as well as neurophysiological examinations were carried out for a 23-year-old woman of mixed Caucasian and Latin American ancestry with a history of cataracts diagnosed at age 1year, she had onset of distal muscle weakness at age 2years progressing to atrophy and ovarian dysgenesis at puberty. The patient was found to have 3-methylglutaconic acid with normal 3 hydroxyisovaleric acid on urine organic acid analysis. POLG sequencing was done and a heterozygous variant, c.2851T>A (p.Y951N) was found which is predicted to be deleterious. There are limited reports of POLG mutations in individuals with 3-methylglutaconic aciduria. This case report of a young woman with a heterozygous mutation in POLG, presenting with muscle weakness and atrophy at a young age aims to aid clinicians in similar challenging diagnostic situations as well as enhances our understanding of POLG-related disease phenotypes.",1
"Published by Elsevier B.V. Introduction Human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is continuously replicated in dividing cells and postmitotic tissues by the nuclear-encoded DNA polymerase gamma (POLG). POLG is the sole mtDNA polymerase and plays a major role in maintaining mtDNA integrity (Milone and Massie, 2010). POLG is a heterotrimer and consists of a catalytic subunit (p140) and 2 smaller identical accessory subunits (p55). The catalytic subunit is encoded by POLG, whereas the accessory subunits are encoded by POLG2. POLG maps to 15q25 and POLG2 maps to 17q21.",0

"The catalytic subunit plays a critical role since it contains both polymerase and proofreading exonuclease activities (Longley et al., 2001). Mutations in POLG represent the most common causes of autosomally inherited mitochondrial diseases in children and adults (Wong et al., 2008). The ﬁrst mutation in POLG was discovered in 2001 in a Belgian family with Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (PEO) (Van Goethem et al., 2001). The phenotype of patients with POLG mutations is often heterogeneous and, as observed in other mitochondrial disorders, may lead to involvement of several organ systems. The reported POLG mutations are inherited either in an autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant manner (DiMauro et al., 2006; Horvath et al., 2006). Diagnosis in a clinical setting may pose a challenge to clinicians and molecular testing including sequencing of POLG in suspected cases can help to reach a diagnosis and institute proper counseling. In this report we present an adult patient with a complicated medical history where multiple evaluations had failed to arrive at a diagnosis until a novel POLG mutation, brieﬂy described in an earlier paper by Tang et al. (2011) was found. The clinical presentation of this patient and its association with a POLG mutation will add to our current knowledge and understanding of POLG-related disease phenotypes.",1

Bekheirnia et al. / Gene 499 (2012) 209–212 Subject and methods Study subject A 23-year-old woman of mixed Caucasian and Mexican descent was evaluated in the Adult Genetics clinic for a history of bilateral cataracts, ovarian dysgenesis and distal muscle weakness and atrophy. Several studies including genetic testing were undertaken over a period of several years to determine a diagnosis, until a ﬁnal diagnosis was reached that explained her presentation. Non-genetic investigations",1
"At age 18years, she had a syncopal episode at school and underwent a diagnostic work-up that included an echocardiogram, EKG, cardiac MRI, brain MRI without contrast and EEG. At age 19years, due to progressive muscle weakness, electromyogram (EMG) and nerve conduction velocities (NCV) were carried out. Based on those results, a skeletal muscle biopsy was undertaken to understand the muscular atrophy. In the Genetics clinic, biochemical testing was sent for acylcarnitine analysis, plasma amino acids, urine organic acids, lactic acid levels, liver function tests and basic metabolic panel. An echocardiogram to determine structural anomalies of the heart was also ordered. A galactose 1-phosphate level was also obtained to rule out GALT deﬁciency due to the history of bilateral cataracts, ovarian dysgenesis and neurological compromise.",1
Genetic testing DNA tests for spinal muscular atrophy and myotonic dystrophy were sent. Sequencing of GJB1 and MPZ was also performed as part of the evaluation for Charcot–Marie Tooth disease. An oligonucleotidebased chromosomal microarray analysis to rule out genomic copy number variants was sent. Based on her overall clinical picture at,0
"age 23years, it was decided to pursue a work-up for mitochondrial disease. Since mutations in POLG are associated with variable presentations that include but are not limited to encephalopathy, parkinsonism, stroke-like episodes, exercise intolerance, ataxia–neuropathy and PEO (progressive external ophthalmoplegia) and limb myopathy, POLG sequencing was pursued. Subsequently, MitoMet array (copy number analysis of metabolic and mitochondrial related genes) was also performed to evaluate for deletions in the POLG gene. Results Clinical history of the subject",1
"The subject was healthy at birth with no signiﬁcant problems during the ﬁrst year of life. At the age of 1year, she developed vision problems and was found to have bilateral cataracts which were removed. At the age of 2years, she manifested increasing difﬁculties with motor movements of both hands that led to delayed ﬁne motor skills which continued to progress, leading to the inability to use both of her hands, with consequent atrophy of arm and hand muscles. At the age of 16years she had a gynecological evaluation due to absent menarche which resulted in the diagnosis of ovarian dysgenesis. Hormone replacement therapy was initiated with appropriate response. At the age of 18years, she had a syncopal episode at school. At the age of 23years, she presented with a seizure like episode of unknown etiology. The episode consisted of generalized",1
"tonic–clonic convulsions without loss of bowel or bladder continence or tongue bite; however, she developed post-ictal confusion. Two months later, she was evaluated at the Adult Genetics clinic. At that time, she was attending college and exhibited an intact cognitive function. Family history was non-contributory for any history of similar conditions. The patient has one sibling, a 24year old brother, who was diagnosed with depression. Clinical ﬁndings in the subject on physical examination (see Supplemental ﬁgure online)",1
"The patient was a thin young woman with a height of 170.2cm (75th–90th percentile) and a weight of 53.9kg (25th percentile). She had remarkable atrophy of arm and hand muscles but no facial dysmorphic features. Pupils were irregular and sluggish bilaterally. On neurological examination she was alert and oriented. There were no cranial nerve deﬁcits and her coordination was normal. There was severe atrophy of arm and hand muscles including biceps, tri-",1
"ceps, forearm and hands with claw hand deformity and digitalization of the thumbs. However, deltoid muscles had normal bulk and tone. Lower extremities were diffusely thin and feet arches were normal. Motor examination in upper extremities revealed her power to be 0/5 at wrist ﬂexors and extensors, hand and forearm and 0/5 at biceps; however, it was 5/5 at deltoid muscles and 3/5 at triceps. At the lower extremities, her power was 5/5 in proximal muscles including hip ﬂexors, quadriceps and hamstrings and 4/5 at tibialis anterior. She displayed absent reﬂexes in upper extremities, whereas her lower extremities had normal symmetric reﬂexes at knees and ankles. The rest of the examination was unremarkable.",1
Results of non-genetic investigations,0
"Echocardiogram, EKG, cardiac MRI, brain MRI without contrast and EEG done at the age of 18years did not detect any abnormalities. NCV revealed diffusely decreased amplitude of compound motor action potentials with otherwise normal motor and sensory responses including sural responses. EMG revealed mixed short and long duration motor unit potentials with normal ﬁring frequency suggestive of a chronic myopathic process affecting the distal muscles although the pattern could also be seen in patients with chronic neurogenic conditions. Skeletal muscle biopsy revealed severe myoﬁber degeneration and on electron microscopy there was evidence of end stage muscle disease that precluded interpretation.",1
Urine organic acid analysis showed presence of 3-methylglutaconic acid with normal 3 hydroxyisovaleric acid excluding the possibility of 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type I. All other biochemical tests were normal. Results of genetic testing,1
"POLG sequencing revealed a heterozygous variant, c.2851T>A (p.Y951N). Mitomet array was normal excluding a deletion on the other POLG allele. Neither parent carried the c.2851T>A (p.Y951N) POLG variant. As there are reports of multiple mtDNA deletions in both dominant and recessive forms of POLG11, a repeat muscle biopsy was considered to look for deletions and to characterize the muscle involvement better. However, the patient declined a repeat biopsy. All other genetic tests were normal. Discussion",1
"The clinical presentation associated with POLG mutations is very heterogeneous. The different clinical phenotypes include: 1) Alpers syndrome 2) PEO with or without Limb Myopathy 3) PEO, Parkinsonism, and Early Menopause 4) Ataxia Neuropathy Spectrum (ANS) disorders 5) Myocerebrohepatopathy Spectrum disorders (MCHS) and",0

"Individuals with early menopause, as well as patients with peripheral neuropathy and/or cataracts have been described in the literature (Milone and Massie, 2010). The presence of ovarian dysgenesis seems to be a variable phenotype similar to early menopause and premature ovarian failure (Ledig et al., 2010). Premature ovarian failure is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by amenorrhea and high serum gonadotropins in women less than 40years old. Ovarian dysgenesis which is characterized by the loss of follicles before puberty, describes the most severe premature ovarian failure outcome (Ledig et al., 2010). Multiple different genetic and non-genetic factors are known to play a role in the development of premature ovarian failure and ovarian dysgenesis (Ledig et al., 2010). Although premature ovarian failure has been described in patients with POLG mutations (Tong et al., 2010), ovarian dysgenesis has not been reported before and to the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report that links ovarian dysgenesis with a POLG mutation.",0
"Although cataracts are not a common clinical ﬁnding associated with mitochondrial disorders, it has been reported in a mitochondrial disorder called Sengers syndrome (Atiq et al., 2004) which is characterized by congenital cataracts, lactic acidosis, skeletal myopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In addition, cataracts have also been described in Autosomal Dominant PEO (adPEO) caused by POLG mutations (Luoma et al., 2004). The mechanism is not known although it has been speculated that deﬁciency of glutathione may cause a significant increase in membrane permeability which in addition to the susceptibility of the lenses to oxidative damage may lead to inactivation of the Na+/K+ pump. This effect in turn may result in ionic changes and cataract development (Reddy et al., 1988).",0
"The onset of muscle weakness in this patient at such a young age is unusual for an autosomal dominant POLG mutation. Although distal myopathy has been previously described in POLG-related diseases (Giordano et al., 2010), it had an adult-onset. Skeletal muscle weakness and exercise intolerance can accompany PEO (Luoma et al., 2004); however, most of the previous reports with either neuropathy or myopathy caused by a heterozygous POLG mutation have been reported in older subjects (Milone and Massie, 2010; Wong et al., 2008). Inter-familial variation in the severity of muscle weakness has been reported (Luoma et al., 2004); however, this level of distal muscle atrophy at a very young age, observed in the current report is an intriguing ﬁnding associated with POLG mutations specially among heterozygous variants. This ﬁnding expands the clinical spectrum associated with POLG-associated disorders.",0
"Epilepsy is commonly observed in children and adults with recessive POLG mutations. Seizures may occur either in the setting of Alpers syndrome, in association with PEO, ataxia, and neuropathy, or as an isolated manifestation of POLG mutations (Atiq et al., 2004). Partial and secondary generalized seizures can occur. An occipital EEG focus has been reported in the majority of the patients. Epilepsy is a very important factor inﬂuencing mortality in patients with POLG mutations. Abnormal brain MRI ﬁndings may develop and cerebral infarct-like lesions have been reported (Deschauer et al., 2007; Engelsen et al., 2008; Tzoulis et al., 2006). Onset of seizures in adulthood as observed in our patient is more likely to be associated with a heterozygous mutation. However, it should be noted that the proband had only one seizure episode and her course could be unpredictable. It is not well known which antiepileptic drugs should be used as ﬁrst or second line agents in POLG-disease and many patients need combined antiepileptic therapy. However, it is well established that sodium valproate should be avoided in POLGdisease or suspected POLG-disease due to the risk of hepatotoxicity and possible liver failure (Kollberg et al., 2006; Tzoulis et al., 2006). The need to avoid valproic acid as an antiepileptic therapy has been emphasized to our proband.",0

It should be noted that Y951 is one of the crucial residues involved in binding incoming nucleotides based on the structure analysis provided in Fig. 1. Enzyme kinetic analysis using a mutant p.Y951A had nearly no polymerase activity of POLG, but maintained the same DNA binding afﬁnity to a DNA template (Lim et al., 2003). Furthermore, p.Y951F, which lacks a phenolic hydroxyl atom, interferes with binding and incorporating incoming deoxynucleotides (Lim et al., 2003). Thus, the presence of the hydroxyl atoms of tyrosine at position 951 appears to be fundamental to incorporate the deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTPs) and to facilitate the nucleotidyl transferase reaction. According to the classiﬁcation of pathogenic mutations proposed in the original POLG structure determination publication (Lee et al., 2009), p.Y951N change would belong to class I mutations which interfere with the catalytic active-site conﬁguration of the POLG enzyme leading to impaired enzymatic activity. Moreover, another class I mutation (p.Y955C change), located at the polymerase catalytic domain of POLG, has been associated with adPEO. This mutation has been shown to be associated with decreased binding afﬁnity to incoming nucleotides, and increased error-rate of polymerase reaction (Graziewicz et al., 2004; Ponamarev et al., 2002). Structurally, the amino acid Y955 is located adjacent to Y951 and their side chain atoms are tightly packed by hydrophobic interactions. Thus, the p.Y955C change is likely to have a direct inﬂuence on the conformation of Y951. It has been proposed that both Y951 and Y955 are parts of the nucleoside binding site of POLG (Lee et al., 2009) and given their intimate chemical interactions, the classiﬁcation of the observed de novo variant in the case herein presented is in line with the dominant phenotype observed and is consistent with other mutations observed in this critical region.",0
"In addition to the evidence for a phenotypic effect caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in our proband, there are also reports of autosomal dominant POLG mutations in the literature (Wong et al., 2008). To determine whether the detected mutation was pathogenic, the parents were tested. Since they had a normal phenotype, presence of this mutation in either of them would point in favor of a familial variant. Parental testing revealed that neither parents were carriers, thus establishing that this was a de novo event in",0

"Another possibility was that the patient had one mutated allele and a second deleted allele which would establish an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. To clarify this further, a MitoMet array was performed which did not demonstrate any copy number variation on the other copy of the POLG gene, thus establishing that the de novo variant, p.Y951N is likely a dominant mutation. However, a second mutant allele deeply embedded in the introns or in the promoter region cannot be ruled out. This patient presented with 3-methylglutaconic acid with normal",0
"3 hydroxyisovaleric acid on urine organic acid analysis. 3Methylglutaconic aciduria (3-MGCA) has 5 distinctive clinical types (Gunay-Aygun, 2005). An elevated amount of 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid (3-HIV) is seen in type I in contrast to normal levels in the other types. In 3-MGCA Type IV, which is mostly connected with mitochondrial dysfunction, most patients present early in life with nonspeciﬁc neurological features like psychomotor retardation and muscle tone abnormalities; however, there have been reports of sensorineural hearing loss and ocular abnormalities including cataracts as observed in our patient (Gunay-Aygun, 2005). A potential association between 3-MGCA and POLG mutations has been published previously by Wortmann et al., 2009. The authors studied 18 children with 3-MGCA type IV with 4 clinical subgroups (encephalomyopathic, hepatocerebral, cardiomyopathic, myopathic). In the children with a hepatocerebral phenotype most with complex I deﬁciency, 3 out of",0
"6 carried either homozygous or compound heterozygous POLGmutations, indicating autosomal recessive inheritance (Wortmann et al., 2009). This current report is yet an evidence of an association between 3-MGCA and POLG-disease.",0
"In summary, the clinical presentation of POLG mutations is fairly heterogeneous and it is difﬁcult to classify patients into speciﬁc syndromes. Here we present a new clinical presentation with cataracts, ovarian dysgenesis and an unusual early onset of distal muscle atrophy and weakness as a result of a heterozygous POLG mutation. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of a deep intronic mutation or a change in the promoter. The possibility of a digenic cause for the observed phenotype as well as distal myopathy of other etiology should also be considered. This report is also an evidence of association between 3-MGCA and an apparently heterozygous POLG mutation.",0

"Mutations in POLG1 are an important cause of human mitochondrial disease. We describe a woman who presented with bilateral ptosis and external ophthalmoplegia at 64 years of age. Neurological examination revealed symptoms of diffuse encephalopathy. The symptoms were progressive and at 67 years she was severely cognitively impaired, had severe bilateral ptosis and complete external ophthalmoplegia. Frequent cytochrome c oxidase-negative fibres were detected in muscle. Electrophysiological examination revealed myopathic changes and axonal neuropathy. Standard laboratory tests were normal. Brain CT showed general, moderate cortical atrophy. Molecular analysis of muscle DNA revealed multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions. Sequencing of the entire POLG1 gene revealed two changes c.2993C>T (p.998S>L) and c.3550G>C (p.1184D>H). Both mutations are previously unreported and confirmed to be compound heterozygous. Late-onset progressive external ophthalmoplegia with severe encephalopathy is an unusual combination in patients with POLG1 mutations. POLG-associated disease should be considered in any patient with unexplained or unusual neurological features.",1
BACKGROUND This case represents two novel compound heterozygous mutations of the POLG1 gene causing an uncommon phenotype with adult-onset progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) and progressive encephalopathy as dominant features. The case depicts the clinical symptoms caused by these novel mutations and further confirms that the possibility of a POLG-associated disease should be considered in any patient with unexplained or unusual neurological features. CASE PRESENTATION,1
"The patient is a woman with an uneventful medical history until the age of 50 years when she had a breast cancer operation. Axillary lymph node evacuation and postoperative radiation treatment was performed at age 54 years. She also had a history of psychiatric symptoms of unknown quality and she had been on antidepressive medication. Her parents had had no known medical conditions. Her father had died at age 75 years and her mother at age 85 years. The patient was her parents’ only child. She had two adult daughters, who were healthy.",1
"At age 64 years she was referred to an ophthalmologist for consideration of surgical treatment of bilateral ptosis. There was no history of diplopia, headache or difficulties with swallowing. At that time, her medication consisted of bisoprolol, losartan, quetiapine and escitalopram. The ophthalmologist confirmed bilateral ptosis, but diagnosed also external ophthalmoplegia. Neurological examination revealed symptoms of diffuse encephalopathy: echolalia, automatic laughter, depression, general cognitive slowness, problems in understanding and following commands in clinical examination, confusion and disorientation, as well as general clumsiness. There were no signs of hemiparesis,",1
"tendon reflexes were weak but symmetric and she had flexor plantar responses. The disease history and the clinical assessment were not suggestive of dementia of Alzheimer type. The patient had no history of seizures or other symptoms suggestive of epilepsy. Her Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score at age 64 years was 27 points out of 30, which is decreased but not indicative of dementia. MMSE was not repeated, but later clinical notes indicate definite progression of the cognitive problems leading to dementia at age 67 years. The patient had slowly progressive symmetric limb muscle weakness. She was not able to move unaided and was not able to live independently. She had severe bilateral ptosis and complete external ophthalmoplegia. She died from pneumonia at age 67 years in a nursing home.",1

"Histological examination of a sample from the right vastus lateralis muscle showed abnormally frequent cytochrome c oxidase (COX)-negative fibres at the age of 64 years (figure 1A). Electrophysiological examination revealed myopathic changes and they were most prominent in facial muscles. Furthermore, sensory more than motor axonal neuropathy was observed. Facial nerve conduction was not studied. An aerobic exercise test was not performed. Acetylcholine receptor antibodies were not detected. Fasting blood glucose, transaminase values, creatinine, creatine kinase, thyroid function tests and serum sodium and potassium were normal. Blood pyruvate was 172 μmol/litre (laboratory reference 40–70 μmol/litre); blood lactate was not determined. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was not performed. Brain CT and MRI showed general cortical atrophy that was not particularly prominent in temporo-parietal structures, and no focal abnormalities. There were no signs",1

"Total DNA was extracted from muscle tissue homogenate using the standard sodium dodecyl sulphateproteinase K method and from blood using QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California, USA). Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions were analysed by long PCR (Expand Long Template PCR System kit; Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Blood DNA was used as a template to amplify and sequence the 23 coding exons of the POLG1 gene (NM_002693) in the proband by automated sequencing (ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA) using the BigDye Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems) after treatment with exonuclease I and shrimp alkaline phosphatase. The novel sequence variants found in POLG1 were confirmed using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.

The p.998S>L substitution destroys a recognition site for Hpy118I leading to an undigested PCR product of 277 bp in size.",0
"OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP Initial analysis for the common mtDNA point mutations m.3243A>G, m.8344A>G and m.8993T>C, as well as Southern blot analysis to demonstrate large mtDNA deletions, were negative. Further molecular analysis revealed multiple mtDNA deletions confirming mitochondrial disease (figure 1B). Sequencing of the entire POLG1 gene revealed two heterozygous nucleotide substitutions: c.2993C>T (p.998S>L) and c.3550G>C (p.1184D>H) (fig- ure 1C). Both are previously unreported. The two daugh-",1
"ters of the proband as well as one child of the elder daughter harboured heterozygous p.1184D>H, but p.998S>L was found only in the proband. These findings confirm that the two novel base exchanges in the proband were heterozygous in trans. DISCUSSION Since 1989, nuclear defects have been implicated as possible aetiologies of mitochondrial disease.1 POLG1 gene encodes the catalytic subunit of pol-, the only DNA polymerase in human mitochondria, and its mutations have emerged as an important aetiology of human mitochondrial disease.2–5",0
"PEO and encephalopathy are both frequent phenotypic features in mitochondrial diseases but, in patients with POLG1 mutations, encephalopathic phenotypes present most often in childhood. The combination of adult-onset PEO and encephalopathy is uncommon.56",0
"Our patient had a PEO-plus phenotype consisting of bilateral ptosis, external ophthalmoplegia and progressive encephalopathy as dominant features. Muscle histology showed COX-negative fibres that were abnormally frequent to the age of the patient. Molecular genetic analysis revealed multiple mtDNA deletions in muscle and heterozygous in trans mutations p.998S>L and p.1184D>H in the POLG1 gene. Neither of them has been described previously, but another pathogenic mutation, p.1184D>N, has previously been described in the position 1184. The p.1184D>N mutation has been described in trans with the exonuclease domain mutation p.227R>W in children with failure to thrive, mental retardation and hypotonia,7 and in adults with a linker region mutation p.468N>D with PEO and tetraparesis.8 Both p.998S>L and p.1184D>H mutations are located in the polymerase domain of pol- in positions that are evolutionarily conserved suggesting that the mutations are pathogenic.",1
"Our patient harboured two novel POLG1 mutations. Her clinical features, a relatively late adult-onset symptom combination of PEO and prominent, dementing, encephalopathy, demonstrate the wide phenotypic variety of the POLG1 mutations. The possibility of a POLG-associated disease should be considered in any patient with unexplained or unusual neurological features.9",1

All rights reserved. Introduction",1
"DNA polymerase gamma (POLG), the only DNA polymerase found in mitochondria, is entirely responsible for all DNA synthetic reactions including mtDNA replication and repair (Hance et al., 2005). POLG is a heterodimeric enzyme containing a Pol I-like catalytic core (PolgA) and an accessory subunit (PolgB), encoded by POLG at locus 15q25 and POLG2 at locus 17q24.1, respectively (Chan and Copeland, 2009). PolgA possesses both polymerase and proofreading exonuclease activities; PolgB increases enzyme's processivity (Lee et al., 2009). Mutations in the catalytic subunit of POLG can cause mtDNA instability, inducing its deletion and/or depletion. Mutation database (http://tools.niehs.nih.gov/ polg/) currently lists more than 150 POLG mutations, which are evenly distributed over the protein sequence. In addition to the clinical heterogeneity, POLG mutations can be either dominant or recessive, posing a great diagnostic challenge for the clinician.",0
"The phenotypic spectrum is wide, including encephalopathy, epilepsy, ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, neuropathy, myopathy and hepatopathy.

In our patient, a novel POLG mutation is associated with ANS plus gastroparesis, which has not been observed previously. The digestive dysregulation could be the result of energy deprivation following mitochondrial loss of function due to accumulation of mtDNA mutations/deletions and decline of respiratory chain function with severe consequences for all energy-dependent cellular functions, including gastric nerve cells. Our report illustrates clinical variability of POLG mutations and underlines the importance of further biochemical and translational research to better address the pathogenicity of POLG dysfunction. In addition, gastric dysmotility should be more readily searched for in this clinical conjuncture.",0

"Abstract: Autosomal recessive ataxias caused by mutations of the polymerase g (POLG) gene make an important group of progressive ataxias accompanied by a diverse spectrum of neurological disorders. Because the clinical picture can be quite miscellaneous, it is challenging to assort patients to any of the currently described syndromes; therefore, to provide such a patient with a conclusive diagnosis can be challenging for the neurologist. A typical magnetic resonance imaging finding is probably the most useful landmark in the diagnostic process, which will steer the clinician toward POLG gene testing. To illustrate this, we present a case of progressive ataxia caused by A467T and W748S mutations of POLG gene, who presented with overlapping symptoms of autosomal recessive mitochondrial ataxic syndrome and SANDO, as well as choreoathetotic movements and dysphonia. After lengthy investigations, magnetic resonance imaging showed T2 and FLAIR hyperintensities in the thalamus, inferior olives, and cerebellum, which led us to the analysis of POLG mutations.",1

In one group, there are disorders in which the phenotype resembles Friedreich ataxia [including polymerase g (POLG) mutations phenotype], whereas the other group includes early-onset ataxias with cerebellar atrophy. This emphasizes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain as an important diagnostic tool.1",0
"Defects in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) may be a product of mutations of mitochondrial or nuclear genome involved in mtDNA homeostasis.2 Mutations of nuclear genes such as mtDNA polymerase (POLG),3 adenine nucleotide transporter,4 and Twinkle, a mitochondrial helicase5 cause mtDNA deletions or a quantitative loss called mtDNA depletion. Although most common phenotypic presentation of these nuclear genome defects is progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO),3 other manifestations have been described, particularly in patients with mutations affecting POLG. Many mitochondrial disorders may include ataxia as an additional sign, but only disorders associated with POLG mutation and infantile-onset spinocerebellar ataxia caused by mutation of the C10orf2 gene that encodes for Twinkle proteins, a mitochondrial helicase, have ataxia as a defining feature.1",0
"We report on a patient with POLG mutations presenting with ataxia, ophthalmoparesis, and some additional features, who was diagnosed on the basis of MRI findings. CASE REPORT",1
"A 32-year-old woman was referred to our center for evaluation of ataxia. Symptoms started at the age of 13 years with difficulties in balancing with closed eyes. At the age of 24, during pregnancy, she developed broad-based gait and paresthesias in the feet. During the next 2 years, she started to develop dysarthria and dysphonia. In an outpatient clinic, she underwent electroneurography, which showed mild slowing of nerve conduction velocities and absent sensory potentials in hands and feet. Brain MRI showed increased signal intensity in both thalami and cerebellar hemispheres. Extensive genetic workup for spinocerebellar ataxias 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 12, 17, DPRLA, and mitochondrial transfer RNA leucine was negative. Studies for ceruloplasmin, vitamin E, a-fetoprotein, ammonium, lactate, pyruvate, carnitine, fatty acids, organic acids, phytanic acid, very long fatty acids, b-hexosaminidase A, galactocerebrosidase, congenital disorders of glycosylation, neuronal lipofuscinosis, oligosaccharides, and mucopolysaccharides in urine were negative.",1
"Neurological examination performed on the patient’s initial presentation revealed almost complete horizontal gaze palsy (only minimal adduction of the right eye was possible). She had severe ataxia of all 4 limbs and gait, reflexes were absent, and choreoathetotic movements of the hands were noted. Complete absence of proprioceptive sensation of the legs was present. Cognitive examination was normal. The Neurologist ● Volume 18, Number 5, September 2012 www.theneurologist.org | 287 Habek et al The Neurologist ● Volume 18, Number 5, September 2012",1
"FIGURE 1. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showing T2 and FLAIR hyperintensities in the thalamus (C, E), inferior olives (A–C), and cerebellum (D). Repeat brain MRI is shown in Figure 1. On the basis of MRI findings, we performed analysis for POLG mutations, which revealed 2 mutations in the POLG gene (1399G > A, A467T and 2243G > C, W748S), both in trans position. The patient was prescribed vitamin C 1 g qid, coenzyme Q10 100 mg tid, L-carnitine 500 mg qid, and lamotrigine 25 mg bid. DISCUSSION",1
"Differential diagnosis of autosomal recessive ataxias is wide. Broadly, they can be divided into 3 groups: (1) Friedreich ataxia-like, (2) Friedreich ataxia-like with cerebellar atrophy, and (3) early-onset ataxia with cerebellar atrophy.1 The second group of ataxias includes 4 diseases: late-onset Tay-Sachs disease, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy, and DNA POLG disorders (mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndrome).",0
"The human mtDNA polymerase, a crucial enzyme for mtDNA replication and repair, is a heterotrimer consisting of a catalytic subunit (POLG) containing the polymerase and exonuclease activities, and 2 accessory subunits (POLG2),6 and is encoded by nuclear POLG gene located on chromosome 15q25.7 The consequence of POLG mutation is the accumulation of multiple mtDNA deletions in postmitotic tissues such as muscle and brain. A great majority of the mutated alleles are missense mutations, whereas frameshift and nonsense mutations account for a smaller portion.8 Numerous mutations of POLG gene have been identified to cause a broad spectrum of disorders inherited in autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner, including the autosomal dominant and recessive forms of PEO,3,9,10 the autosomal recessive lethal Alpers syndrome,11,12 the mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndrome with13 and without ophthalmoplegia,14 ataxic neuropathy with dysarthria and ophthalmoparesis (SANDO),15 parkinsonism,16 and male infertility.17 As reported by Wong et al,8 in a cohort of 350 patients, the most common POLG mutation in patients with autosomal recessive inheritance (Alpers disease, ataxia, sensory neuropathy, and PEO syndromes) was A467T, followed by G848S and T251I + P587L (in cis), W748S and T914P. Our patient was found to be compound heterozygous (A467T and W748S mutations).",0
"Clinical presentation of recessive POLG mutations is expanded by ataxia and the neuropathy spectrum,8 combined with variable features of involvement of central nervous system and other organs. Our patient presented with ataxic syndrome, which includes an overlapping spectrum of disorders organized around the finding of ataxia demonstrating recessive inheritance, primarily due to its onset before the age of 20 and presence of peripheral sensory neuropathy. Most patients have",0
"additional symptoms, which may include PEO, neuropathy, and dysarthria. MRI is very helpful in deciding when to order genetic testing for POLG mutations as MRI shows characteristic lesions that are hyperintense relative to gray matter. Typically, these are seen centrally in the posterior part of the thalamus, dentate nuclei, and inferior olives, and probably are caused by neuronal loss with secondary gliosis.12,18 These MRI findings after lengthy investigations revealed the true etiology of symptoms in our patient. The involvement of these particular brain areas can be explained not just with highenergy demands of the brain region involved but also with secondary vascular effects due to pH changes.12",0
"Taking into account the genetic, clinical, and neuroradiologic findings, SANDO or autosomal recessive mitochondrial ataxic syndrome due to mitochondrial POLG mutations were the 2 syndromes considered in our patient. SANDO comprises of a triad of sensory ataxic neuropathy, dysarthria, and ophthalmoparesis.19 Palatal tremor and memory loss have been reported as additional symptoms.13 Besides POLG mutations, other gene mutations can cause this syndrome as it is a genetically heterogenous disease.20 POLG mutations that are reported to be the cause of SANDO include A467T, R627W, H932Y, and G1051R.10,21–23",0
"Autosomal recessive mitochondrial ataxic syndrome is characterized by gait and limb ataxia, dysarthria, polyneuropathy, hyporeflexia, nystagmus, cognitive impairment, epilepsy, and in some cases ophthalmoparesis. POLG mutations have been found in A467T and T748S.1,14",0
"We present a case exhibiting features of both SANDO and autosomal recessive mitochondrial ataxic syndrome. Recently, some authors were inclined to include these 2 syndromes as well as spinocerebellar ataxia with epilepsy into the ataxia neuropathy spectrum or syndrome.23,24 In addition, our patient presented with choreoathetotic movements and dysphonia. As there is a huge inconsistency in muscle biopsy and biochemical findings in patients with POLG mutations,13 brain MRI is the diagnostic procedure of choice that can lead to molecular analysis of POLG gene, thus yielding definitive diagnosis. Because there is no clear correlation between genotype and phenotype in patients with POLG mutations, we believe it to be clinically more useful to consider POLG mutation-related phenotype as a clinical entity with a diverse symptomatic presentation.",1

Our case had features suggestive of MSCAE, in which the most common presenting features are gait disorders, epilepsy, ataxia, neuropathy and headache.

Such cerebellar white matter changes have a very limited differential diagnosis, including histiocytosis, peroxisomal disorders, and Alexander disease [7].

"ABSTRACT – Epilepsy is a common manifestation of mitochondrial disease associated with mutations of the mitochondrial polymerase -y (POLG). Prognosis of mitochondrial epilepsy is often poor and there are few reports of successful treatment of POLG-related epilepsy. We describe a 26-year-old woman who experienced severe headache during a three-day period, followed by symptoms of visual ﬂashing, speech difﬁculty, and generalised seizures. EEG recording showed non-convulsive status epilepticus (left occipital area) and brain MRI revealed parieto-occipital T2-hyperintensities. Visual aura and aphasia persisted despite antiepileptic medication with phenytoin, oxcarbazepine, and levetiracetam. Mitochondrial disorder was clinically suspected and a homozygous c.2243G>C mutation (p.Trp748Ser) was discovered in the POLG1 gene. The patient was then set on a low glycaemic index treatment (LGIT) variant of the ketogenic diet, after which the headaches, aphasia, and visual aura progressively improved and disappeared. She returned home two weeks after onset of symptoms and has not had further seizures. She continues to receive levetiracetam monotherapy and LGIT. We conclude that, at least for this patient, the combination of three antiepileptic drugs and LGIT is effective and well tolerated as treatment for severe episodes of POLG-related mitochondrial epilepsy.",1

Meningoencephalitis or cerebral sinus thrombosis were not considered likely. The patient was admitted to the neurological ward for follow-up, but no antiepileptic medication was started.",1
"On day 5, the patient had yet another seizure and intravenous phenytoin was initiated. She had severe headache with persistent visual aura, despite treatment with conventional analgesics, and a right homonymous hemianopia. She had word ﬁnding difﬁculties but normal comprehension and she was not able to perform simple numerical tasks (e.g. counting down from 100). On day 6, EEG revealed slight slowing-down of background and continuous epileptiform polyspike and slow-wave complexes occurring pseudo-periodically at 0.5 to 2-second intervals within the left temporo-parieto-occipital region, with negative maximum at the occipital electrode O1. These complexes were very similar to the rhythmic, highamplitude, delta activity with polyspikes (RHADS) previously reported in children with POLG-related status epilepticus (Wolf et al., 2009); however, in this adult patient, the amplitude of the delta waves only reached 130 µV (ﬁgure 1).

"EEG ﬁndings were compatible with NCSE. On the same day, brain MRI revealed new T2-hyperintense, oedemic lesions in the left thalamus and left parieto-occipital region (ﬁgure 2). Oxcarbazepine and levetiracetam were added to antiepileptic medication. POLG-related mitochondrial disorder was now suspected based on clinical symptoms as well as EEG and MRI ﬁndings (Uusimaa et al., 2008; Wolf et al., 2009) and genetic testing was requested. On day 7, she was given LGIT (for details, see Pfeifer and Thiele [2005]) which has been reported to be useful in patients with intractable epilepsy (Kossoff and Hartman, 2012; Pfeifer and Thiele, 2005). The diet was well tolerated with no signiﬁcant side effects. The patient’s condition improved such that the headaches, aphasia, and visual aura gradually disappeared during the following four days. There were no further seizures. At discharge on day 12, she still had homonymous right-sided visual ﬁeld defect, which resolved slowly. Two months later, the visual ﬁelds were normal. During the follow-up, the patient did not have further seizures. Phenytoin and oxcarbazepine were gradually discontinued and she continues to receive levetiracetam monotherapy and LGIT. Genetic testing revealed a homozygous c.2243G>C mutation of the POLG1 gene leading to p.Trp748Ser.",1

"The ketogenic diet, including LGIT, has several plausible anticonvulsant mechanisms, such as increased energy production and increased -y-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synthesis in the brain (Bough and Rho, 2007; Kossoff and Hartman, 2012). In addition, recent animal study data suggest that a ketogenic diet may have beneﬁcial effects for mitochondrial disorders (Ahola-Erkkilä et al., 2010). POLG-related mitochondrial disease is common in the population, e.g. in Finland, the carrier frequency of the p.Trp748Ser allele is estimated to be 1:125 (Hakonen et al., 2005). In POLG-related mitochondrial epilepsy, progression to status epilepticus is common and this condition may be highly resistant to treatment (Tzoulis et al., 2006). Beneﬁt of magnesium treatment has recently been reported in two patients with refractory status epilepticus and another homozygous POLG1 mutation (p.Ala467Thr) (Visser et al., 2011). Magnesium treatment was, however, not applied for the treatment of the patient reported here. We conclude that the combination of phenytoin, oxcarbazepine, levetiracetam, and LGIT was effective and well tolerated in a patient with severe episodes of POLG-related mitochondrial epilepsy manifesting as NCSE. We suggest that combining LGIT to antiepileptic drug treatment should be considered in this potentially life-threatening condition. □",0

Herein, we report the 2-year neurological follow up of one of these patients disclosing over time a clinical phenotype highly consistent with MELAS. Case presentation Patient’s history",1
"A 74 year old man was admitted to the Neurological Unit of Desio Hospital in September 2004 for sudden onset of a speech disorder and left side weakness. Over the past ten years he developed a progressive bilateral ptosis, hearing loss and difficulties in swallowing. For these symptoms he was hospitalized in 1996 elsewhere. The neurological examination performed at that time revealed bilateral ptosis, bilateral hearing loss and mild dysphagia. The neurophysiological examination, performed in 1996, revealed a myopathic pattern. However, at that time the patient refused any further investigation including muscle biopsy. The remaining patient’s past history was unremarkable. In particular, except for a mild increase in cholesterol levels, cerebrovascular risk factors were absent. Family history was negative for muscular disorders, stroke, hearing loss, diabetes, short stature, headache, mental retardation or dementia. Neurological examination, performed on admission in 2004, revealed bilateral ptosis and severe ophthalmoparesis, hearing loss, dysarthria, left facial nerve palsy and mild left side hemiparesis. Acute phase NIHSS score was 4. Fatigability and myotonic phenomena were absent. Acute phase cerebral CT scan was negative for acute ischemic lesions. Cerebral MRI, performed two days later, showed a right pre-rolandic hyperintensity on T2weighted sequence, not confined to a specific vascular territory, with a slight enhancement after gadolinium, consistent with an acute ischaemic lesion. Other bilateral focal hyperintensities, mostly in the posterior circulation territory (cerebellar bilateral, left temporo-occipital and frontal) consistent with stabilized ischaemic lesions, were also found (Figure 1). Biochemistry was normal except for increased level of serum creatine kinase (189→643, n.v 38–174 U/l). Inflammatory and autoimmune markers were normal as well as lactate serum level (1,7; n.v 0.51.8 mmol/l). Electrocardiogram, echocardiography and abdominal ultrasonography were negative. Audiometry revealed a moderate sensorimotor bilateral hypoacusia. Ophthalmological examination, including fluoroangiography, excluded a pigmentary retinopathy. Electroencephalography was normal too. Neurophysiological examination demonstrated myopathic signs in frontal, masseters, orbicularis oculi and mouth muscles without denervation and normal findings in the other examined muscles (right biceps, triceps, interosseous and left and right quadriceps,",1
"tibialis anterior, medial gemellus). No signs of polyneuropathy were detected. Ticlopidine 250 mg twice daily was started. Left hemiparesis resolved completely within 7 days. During the following years a progressive worsening of ptosis, ophthalmoparesis, hearing loss and dysphagia was observed. Cognitive impairment was not detected at MMSE. Headache and seizures were not referred too. In November 2008 the patient was hospitalized again for a sudden onset of aphasia. No other new-onset neurological symptoms were referred. The neurological examination performed at that time showed global aphasia and a right hemiparesis with right Babinski sign. The NIHSS score was 4. Residual signs such as severe bilateral ptosis, bilateral opthalmoparesis, bilateral hearing loss, dysarthria, solid food dysphagia were unchanged. Fatigability, cerebellar ataxia or sensitive deficits were absent. Biochemistry, echocardiography, epiaortic vessel Doppler ultrasound were normal. Cerebral CT scan performed in the acute phase was unmodified in comparison to the previous ones. Cerebral MRI at day 3 demonstrated a small corticalsubcortical left temporo-occipital lesion with DWI restriction (Figure 1). The strength deficit resolved in a few days whereas a language rehabilitation was necessary. Aphasia progressively recovered and was not present at the three months follow-up. The patient continued to assume ticlopidine.",1

"Total DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and muscle. PCR-RFLP analysis did not reveal m.3243A>G mutation. Southern blot analysis of muscle mtDNA [11] revealed the presence of several bands compatible with mtDNA multiple deletions (Figure 2). A specific PCR assay identified mtDNA multiple deletions using two primers (forward 7440–7465 and reverse complement 16135–16110) and the following amplification protocol: an initial denaturation at 94°C for 2 min, followed by 25 cycles (94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 68°C for 90 s) and a final extension for 2 min at 72°C (Platinum HiFi Taq Polymerase by Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The entire coding sequence of POLG1 gene (NM_002693.1) was PCR-amplified and directly sequenced disclosing the presence of three heterozygous variants: the c.752C>T (exon 3, p.T251I), c.1760C>T (exon 10, p.P587L) and c.3556G>C (exon 22, p.D1186H).

DNA sample and muscle biopsy were collected after obtaining patient informed consent according to the local ethics and privacy and human subjects’ protection regulations and were taken as part of standard patient care. Conclusion,0
"The human mitochondrial genome is replicated by the DNA polymerase γ, pol γ, which is encoded by POLG1, which is a 23 exons nuclear gene located on chromosome 15q25. Heterozygous and homozygous POLG1 mutations have been typically associated with heterogeneous and severe clinical phenotypes of PEO, both in autosomal dominant or recessive form. They can also result in adult onset cerebellar ataxia with mtDNA multiple deletions and Alpers syndrome, an autosomal recessive hepatocerebral disease characterized by severe developmental delay, intractable seizures, liver failure and death in childhood. Moreover, throughout the years a wide spectrum of clinical findings including parkinsonism, neuropathy, optic neuritis, psychiatric disorders has been described in POLG1 mutations carriers [12,14-19]. Deschauer et al. 2007 described a patient presenting with occipital seizures and residual homonymous hemianopsia, headache and ataxia and carrying two heterozygous POLG1 mutations [7]. The presence of occipital symptoms and lesions, interpreted as stroke-like episodes, together with elevated CSF lactate and ragged red fibers, posed the suspicion of MELAS, raising the question whether POLG1 mutations could be associated with a MELAS like phenotype [7,20]. However, given several clinical differences between POLG1 patient characteristics and MELAS, it has been supposed that, despite some overlapping symptoms, POLG1 represent a distinct clinical and genetic entity. POLG-associated encephalopathy has been postulated to give rise to a distinct phenotype, including variable age at onset, either recessive or dominant inheritance pattern and peculiar neuroimaging",0
findings characterized by predominant posterior ischemic lesions and lack of cerebral calcification [21].,0
"Our case had some atypical aspects for MELAS such as late onset, lack of cerebral calcification and presence of frontal and occipital MRI lesions better consistent with the POLG associated-encephalopathy spectrum. However, it is difficult to assess with certainty whether our patient could be classified as MELAS-like or POLGassociated encephalopathy. Moreover, although the patient did not present any vascular risk factor, given the elderly age a co-incidence between a POLG myopathy and a cerebrovascular disease can not be excluded at all. However, it is difficult to compare MELAS, which is a clearly defined clinical syndrome, with POLG1-associated encephalopathy, which is so far a purely molecularly defined syndrome with a quite heterogeneous clinical picture. In addition, although 140 POLG mutations have been described in patients with symptoms that suggest mitochondrial disease, most of mutations are reported in heterozygous in whom each POLG allele can be one or more different mutations and only few of these has been replicated in not related families. This makes difficult a clear definition of phenotype and in providing evidence of",0
the disease causing nature of these mutations [22].,0
"Our patient harboured the haplotype p.[T251I P587L] in combination with D1186H located in polymerase domain. The haplotype T251I and P587L has been already described but it is currently not possible to know whether T251I or P587L is the primary pathogenic allele or whether both mutations are necessary to cause disease. Nevertheless both variants have also been reported in trans one each other in affected subjects. Notably both P587 and D1186 residues are located in the DNA binding channel of POLG enzyme. Thus, the substitutions found in our patient could be consistent with a reduced DNA binding capacity.",1

"Abstract Mutations in the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of polymerase g (POLG1) are a major cause of human mitochondrial disease. More than 150 different point mutations in the gene have been reported to be disease causing, resulting in a large range of clinical symptoms. Depending on the mutation or combination of mutations, disease onset can occur in early infancy or late in adult life. Here, we describe the use of multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis to detect deletions within POLG1, which could otherwise go undetected by solely sequencing of the gene. We present a case where an entire POLG1 allele is deleted, with a known pathogenic mutation (W748S) on the remaining allele. The deletion was found in a boy with Alpers syndrome, presenting at 18 months of age with slightly retarded motor development, balance problems, and seizures. Administration of valproic acid (VPA) led to",1
"rapidly progressive fatal liver failure in our patient, and we would like to highlight the need to carry out complete POLG1 gene analysis before administration of VPA in cases of pediatric seizure disorders of unknown origin. Debut and severity of the disease in this patient was unique when compared to homozygous or heterozygous patients with the W748S mutation, leading to the conclusion that gene dosage plays a role in the clinical phenotype of this disease. Introduction",1

"Mutations in the gene for POLG1 are major causes of human mitochondrial disease. The first POLG1 mutation associated with disease was described in 2001 (Van Goethem et al. 2001). Since then, approximately 150 pathogenic mutations have been identified (http://tools. niehs.nih.gov/polg) and linked to a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes, ranging from severe progressive neurodegenerative disorders in early childhood, to milder syndromes with onset in adult age.

Laboratory investigations revealed liver involvement with increased serum levels of transaminases, g-glutamyl-transpeptidase, prothrombin-INR (international normalized ratio), and ammonia. He had elevated blood lactate 2.8–3.9 mmol/L (normal <2,3). Although VPA was stopped within a few days from admission, his liver disease progressed and he developed an acute, fulminant, and noncholestatic liver failure with severe coagulopathy.

Sequencing reactions were carried out on the PCR products followed by sequencing on a 3130xl DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). For sequencing of the deletion breakpoint, a forward primer 50-AAGGGCTGAGATGGCATCTC-30 was designed within the multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) probe C15igs7 and reverse 50-AGAGAAGTGTGTTGACATGCC-30 within the MLPA probe C15igs6, as both probes were known to lie outside of the deletion (Table 1). The Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) was used to amplify the junction breakpoint using these primers and successful amplicons were sequenced.",0
Multiplex Ligation Dependent Probe Amplification Analysis,0
"MLPA analysis, using kit P010 (MRC Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), for detection of deletions or duplications of each exon of the POLG1 gene was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol, starting from 100 ng DNA. The PCR products were separated by capillary electrophoresis on an ABI 3130xl genetic analyzer. Trace data was analyzed using the GeneMapper v3.7 software, and the integrated peak heights were exported to an Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft) for further calculations. For each sample, the peak heights were first normalized to the average peak height of the control probes, followed by normalization to the average peak height of the control samples included in the run. The analysis was considered acceptable if the ratio for the internal control was between 0.8 and 1.2. Threshold values for deletions and duplications were set at 0.7 and 1.3, respectively.",0
"Synthetic probes to narrow down the breakpoint regions were designed as previously described (Barbaro et al. 2008; Stern et al. 2004). Different probe combinations, together with the EK1 reagent kit (MRC Holland), were used for the MLPA reactions. Quantification analysis was performed as described above. Synthetic probe sequences, together with their results, are summarized in Table 1. Results",0
"Morphological studies of the muscle biopsy showed a slightly increased amount of fat in the muscle, but no other abnormalities. Mitochondrial ATP production rate and respiratory chain enzyme activities were normal.",1
"Sequencing of all coding exons and exon/intron boundaries of the POLG1 gene revealed that the patient was homozygous for the W748S mutation. The father was shown to be a heterozygote carrier, whilst the mother lacked the mutation completely. Interestingly, the mother was homozygous for an intronic change (c.2074-22T), which the patient had not inherited. This led us to believe that the patient had a deletion in one of his POLG1 alleles, either a spontaneous deletion or one inherited from his mother.",1
"MLPA analysis revealed that the entire POLG1 gene was deleted on one allele in both the patient and the mother. By designing synthetic probes for MLPA, we could narrow down the breakpoint region and determine that the centromeric and telomeric breakpoints lie between probes c15igs7-c15igs13, and probes c15igs11-c15igs6, respectively (Fig 2). Following this, the breakpoint region was amplified by extra long PCR and sequenced, establishing that the deletion was almost 118 kb in length. The presence of a 4-bp microhomology region at the breakpoint junction indicates that the deletion was created by a nonhomologous end-joining mechanism. In addition to the deletion of POLG1, an adjacent gene, FANCI, was also completely deleted.",1
Discussion,0
"Alpers syndrome is a disease in the severe end of the POLG disease spectrum, clinically characterized by intractable epilepsy, psychomotor regression, and hepatopathy, with or without liver failure (OMIM#203700). Additional symptoms such as ataxia, hypotonia, and cortical blindness are frequently seen (McFarland et al. 2008). Onset is usually in early childhood, although later forms exist (Uusimaa et al. 2008). Skeletal muscle is not always affected and a muscle biopsy often turns out to be normal in children with Alpers syndrome. Bicknese et al. described VPA induced liver toxicity in children with Alpers syndrome already in 1992. Since then, several cases have been reported, often with fatal outcome (Kayihan et al. 2000). The mechanism of VPA-induced liver failure in POLG disease is not clear; however, VPA is known to affect the mitochondrial respiratory chain function, among other ways by inhibition of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (Silva et al. 2008). Its effect on POLG and mtDNA replication has not been investigated. This case",0

"The association between Alpers syndrome and POLG1 mutations is well established (Longley et al. 2005). The genotype can vary, but most cases of Alpers syndrome carry either of the two linker mutations A467T or W748S, in compound heterozygous with another POLG1 mutation (Nguyen et al. 2005). Recent crystallization of POLG has shown that the W748S mutation is located in a globular subdomain of the linker region, which contacts the primertemplate DNA complex to promote intrinsic processivity of POLG (Lee et al. 2009; Falkenberg and Larsson 2009).",0
"In our patient cohort, we have diagnosed four children compound heterozygous for the W748S mutation. They all had early onset of symptoms, including intractable epilepsy, and died before 16 months of life. In addition, we have diagnosed three patients who are homozygous for the W748S mutation. The first patient had mild cognitive problems, ataxia, and nystagmus with the onset of epilepsy at 16 years of age.

Introduction Mutations of the mitochondrial polymerase c (POLG) gene are responsible for a broad clinical spectrum of mitochondrial disorders with a predominant recessive mode of inheritance.1,2 We report a patient presenting with bilateral ptosis, progressive external ophthalmoplegia (EO) and chronic axonal sensory polyneuropathy associated with episodes of optic neuritis, facial hypoesthesia and myelitis. Serial cerebral and spinal MRI revealed multiple sclerosis (MS)-like lesions. Sequencing of POLG found two recessive pathogenic mutations.",1
Case report A 59-year-old woman was referred to our unit for neuro-ophthalmological disorders.,1
"Her medical history began at age 39 with a bilateral progressive ptosis. Blood analyses, including anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies, were negative. Electroneuromyogram (EMG) showed a chronic axonal sensory polyneuropathy with normal neuromuscular transmission. At age 49, diplopia with EO appeared and progressively worsened. At age 59, a mitochondriopathy was suspected because of bilateral ptosis, complete EO, sensory ataxia, proximal muscular deﬁcit, and presence of hyperlactacidemia and axonal sensory polyneuropathy on a second EMG. A deltoid muscle biopsy revealed typical features of mitochondrial myopathy (Fig. 1). Long-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of muscle mitochondrial (mt) DNA showed multiple DNA deletions and real-time PCR found a decrease of mtDNA copy number. The genetic search for mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) and myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red ﬁbers was negative. Sequencing of POLG found two reces-",1

"In addition to symptoms related to POLG, the patient experienced, at 51 and 56 years of age respectively, acute visual loss (left eye) with central scotoma and acute blurred vision (right eye) with retro-ocular pain, both improving after intravenous methylprednisolone. At age 57, a hypoesthesia in the left trigeminal territory resolved spontaneously. Four months later, she presented with hypoesthesia of the left lower limb related to a thoracic myelitis (Fig. 2A). At age 59, optical coherence tomography showed bilateral papillary loss of nerve ﬁbers. Blood tests, including neuromyelitis optica antibodies, were normal. The patient always refused lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal ﬂuid analysis. Brain MRI was suggestive of a condition mimicking MS and showed that lesion load varied with time (Fig. 2B–E).",1
Discussion We report a patient with symptoms related to a novel compound heterozygous mutation of POLG associated with remitting/ relapsing neurological events suggestive of an MS-like disease.,0
"Our patient presented clinical, biological, electrophysiological and histological features typical of mitochondriopathy related to POLG mutations.1,2 Sequencing of the POLG found a mutation already known as deleterious (c.2564T>C)1 and a novel c.1190C>T mutation, now classiﬁed as deleterious according to following criteria: association with a known deleterious mutation and co-segregation with the disease within the family; signiﬁcant depletion and multiple deletions of muscle mtDNA; pathogenic status of the mutation as evidenced by the great inter-species conservation and by its absence in 250 patients and 100 controls.",1

"Recently, POLG variations associated with clinically isolated syndrome have been reported.4 Primary mitochondrial diseases due to mtDNA or nuclear DNA mutations have been implicated in white matter lesions suggestive of a central nervous system inﬂammatory pathology.5 Recent data suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction might favour an inappropriate immune response6 such as in Leber hereditary optic neuropathy and in optic atrophy type 1 gene mutations,7 both disorders having been reported with MS-like disease characteristics.8,9",0
"The polymerase gamma encoded by POLG is the only polymerase able to replicate and repair mtDNA, therefore any POLG mutation may induce deleterious effects on mtDNA synthesis and consequently result in a mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, mitochondrial gene defects could potentiate mitochondrial dysfunction induced by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in inﬂammatory lesions and therefore increase the vulnerability of energy-demanding demyelinated axons.5,6 This suggests that targeting mitochondrial dysfunction could have beneﬁt in treating some inﬂammatory disease.10",0

"Mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (POLG1) is a nuclear-encoded protein critical for the synthesis, replication and repair of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Abnormal function of this sole mtDNA polymerase leads to defective oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production. Impaired integrity of mtDNA with its depletion or deletion causes a broad spectrum of both non-neurological and neurological phenotypes [1]. Greater than one hundred pathogenic mutations in this enzyme have been found since it was first described [2]. These include, but are not limited to parkinsonism, chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO), cerebellar ataxia, sensory polyneuropathy, Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome, which is characterized by progressive encephalopathy with seizures and hepatic failure, isolated myoclonic epilepsy or non-syndromic liver failure.

"Presented patient is a 79-year old Caucasian who developed first neurologic problems in his thirties with bilateral ptosis and double vision. The ophthalmologic examination showed a progressive ophthalmoplegia and he required several corrective eyelid surgeries to mitigate his ptosis. Shortly thereafter, he developed a shuffling gait and overall slowness of movements. He experienced a gradual progression of his rigidity, bradykinesia without any significant asymmetry, hypophonia and within 10–15 years he also developed camptocormia with subsequent postural instability (Additional file 1).",1

Family history was positive for external ophthalmoplegia and Parkinson’s disease diagnosed in his father and brother. We could not personally examine his brother but available history indicated that he was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease and reported a good response to 600 mg of levodopa per day.",1
We performed muscle biopsy because of suspicion for a mitochondrial disorder at the age of 70 years. Muscle biopsy obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle revealed nonspecific changes with some irregularities of cytochrome c-oxidase staining but ragged red fibers were not seen. These changes alone were not sufficient for the definite diagnosis of a mitochondrial myopathy. Repeat biopsy was considered with sampling of additional muscles but the patient declined. Brain MRI showed only mild scattered white matter abnormalities.,1
Sequencing of the POLG1 gene was done by Sanger sequencing. DNA extraction from blood was carried out using standard procedures. All exons of the POLG1 gene were amplified by PCR reaction with previously published intron-based primers [7]. Bidirectional Sanger sequencing was performed for each amplicon and detected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were compared with available public domain databases. We identified a novel heterozygous p.K512M mutation (c.1535A>T) (Figure 1). In silico analysis of this single nucleotide polymorphism,1
"using PolyPhen-2 software (http://genetics.bwh.harvard. edu/pph2) predicted that this change is possibly damaging with a score of 0.906 (sensitivity 0.82 and specificity 0.94). This is a highly conserved position in the linker region of the POLG1 protein (Figure 2) and sequencing of 100 normal, ethnically matched control individuals did not identify this sequence changes, further supporting its role as a disease-causing mutation.",0
"Mutations in the adenosine nucleotide translocator 1 (ANT1) and twinkle (C10ORF2) genes have also been associated with CPEO and additional neurologic problems, including parkinsonism [8,9]. We also sequenced all coding exons of these genes using the same approach as for POLG1 analysis but no putative mutations were identified. Conclusions",0

"The mitochondrial polymerase gamma (POLG) represents a major human disease gene and may account for up to 25% of all mitochondrial diseases, at least in UK and in Italy [1]. Among the possible clinical presentations, Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome (AHS) in children and inherited progressive external ophthalmoparesis (PEO) in adults — either as the sole manifestation or in association with additional neurological features [2,3] — are the most common. Movement disorders are possible manifestations in AHS and have occasionally been described in adult PEO [4]. Case presentation",0

"The present report offers two main considerations. The patient we described combines the clinical features of SANDO syndrome complicated with late-onset Parkinsonism and mood disorder. In previous years, coexistence of Parkinsonism and POLG mutations has been described, suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction might play a role in the pathogenesis of PD [7]. Our case report is further evidence that abnormal oxidative metabolism and loss of mtDNA integrity might be implicated in similar conditions. Whilst is evident that POLG does not represent a frequent etiology in PD-like",1
"syndromes, it seems not too speculative to hypothesize that alterations in mtDNA fidelity and subsequent impaired protein synthesis likely compromise mitochondrial bioenergetics, dynamics, transport, or their combination, in dopaminergic neurons [8]. Similar to other cases of “mitochondrial parkinsonisms”, our patient had benefit with antiparkinson drugs, underling the importance of a correct diagnosis [4,9-12].",0
"A further consideration emerges from the evidence of an additional association between the POLG p.A899T variant and SANDO syndrome. The p.A899T has initially been described in compound heterozygosity [13,14] and frequently associated with the clinical triad of sensory ataxic, ptosis, and PEO together with a mood disorder and a movement disorder such as Dopamineagonist responsive parkinsonism. In the face of an ever increasing, pleiomorphic array of features associated with mutations in POLG [15], identification of apparent mutation-specific clinical characteristics might facilitate molecular confirmation in complex patients, prevent possible co-morbidities, and permit to adopt effective symptomatic therapies.",0

"Methods: In a cohort of 756 parkinsonian patients the incidence and outcome of AC was prospectively assessed. A total of 142 of the parkinsonian patients were tested for genetic mutations because of familial parkinsonism, and 20 patients resulted positive: in four the mutation deﬁnitely involved mitochondrial functions (POLG1, PINK1), two presented with LRRK2 mutation, nine presented with GBA mutation and ﬁve presented with Park 4 diﬀerent mutations.",0
"Results: Akinetic crisis occurred in 30 patients for an incidence of 2.8‰ persons/ year and was lethal in seven (23%), not dissimilarly from known incidences of this complication. Yet six of 30 patients were carriers of genetic mutations, one GBA, one LRRK2, one POLG1 and three PINK1. In POLG1 and PINK1 carriers, the syndrome was recurrent and was fatal in three. Incidence of AC was 3.0‰ in familiar parkinsonism, 21.2‰ in genetic parkinsonisms. Conclusions: Our preliminary ﬁndings suggest that the incidence of AC is remarkably increased in carriers of these genetic mutations. Introduction",0
"Akinetic crisis (AC), also termed malignant syndrome or Parkinson hyperpirexia syndrome, neuroleptic-like malignant syndrome or acute akinesia, is a complication that appears in parkinsonism because of treatment manipulations or withdrawal, infectious diseases, trauma or gastrointestinal tract diseases [1]. AC is the most severe complication of PD occurring with an annual incidence of three cases per 1000 parkinsonian patients, and consists of acute motor symptom worsening characterized by an akinetic state with dysphagia, hyperthermia, increment of serum CPK and myoglobin, dysautonomia and transient unresponsiveness to current antiparkinsonian treatment or to an increment of dopaminergic drug doses [1]. Its symptoms are identical to symptoms of neuroleptic malig-",0

"Cohort or multicenter studies highlighted the relevance of this complication of parkinsonism [1,5]. An operating deﬁnition of AC was also provided in order to facilitate diagnosis in patients already followed for their PD: ‘… sudden worsening of Uniﬁed Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor score by 20 or more points, accompanied by three or more days of unresponsiveness to the same drug regimen that adequately corrected symptoms before the appearance of akinesia or of unresponsiveness to rescue drugs’ (i.e. injectable apomorphine, amantadine, levodopa esters) [1].",0

Methods The study is the prolongation of a previous study describing the incidence of AC in a cohort of 756 PD patients admitting only patients who were putatively diagnosed as aﬀected by PD according to UK Brain Bank criteria [7] (with the exception of the patient aﬀected by POLG1 mutation), who were regularly followed in our clinic, who were responsive to L-Dopa",0

"Of the 756 cohort patients, 142 presented with familial parkinsonism (76 with a ﬁrst degree relative involved); genetic testing was performed in all the 142 familial parkinsonisms and in two juvenile patients with no known familial transmission (yet both were tested negative).",0
"Genetic testing was targeted according to the possible mode of inheritance, age at onset and clinical presentation of patients, on the following possible gene mutations: Park 8 (LRRK2) [exons 29, 31, 35, 41 (G2019S and I2020T) and 48]; GBA (p.L444P [c.1448 T>C], p.N370S [c.1926 A>G], E326K [c.1093 G>A]); Park 4 (SNCA [p.A53T], SNCB [p.L444P]).

He had been described in a previous paper [9] and had been followed for 10 years for progressive external ophthalmoplegia and ragged red ﬁber myopathy [9].

"Post hoc analysis evaluated whether phenotypic variables, UPDRS at admission, H/Y stage at admission, treatments or presence of genetic mutations inﬂuenced the occurrence of AC, and whether the same variables inﬂuenced the outcome of AC, i.e. fatality or recovery. AC occurrence",0
"As reported in the previous study, only AC duration (in days) could predict the outcome (the longer the duration of AC, the higher the probability of fatal outcome). Other variables such as UPDRS scores, comorbidities at admission and during AC, progression of disease, disease stage were equally distributed in patients with and without AC (Table 1). Disease duration was also similar, probably because of the method used to reduce attrition biases.",0
"Table 2 shows that AC was observed in 30 of 756 cohort patients after a mean of 14.3 ± 2.7 years of follow-up (for a total of 10 828 PYs; overall incidence 2.8 9 1000 PYs). Of the 30 AC cases, 24 occurred amongst the 614 patients with non-familial PD (2.7 9 1000 PYs) and six in the 142 patients with familial PD (3.0 9 1000 PYs). The latter six cases were all diagnosed amongst the 20 patients with a genetic mutation (21.2 9 1000 PYs): four were carriers of genetic mutations involving the mitochondrial functions (one POLG1, three PINK1), one had LRRK2 mutation and one was a carrier of GBA mutation. The incidence of AC in non-genetically determined PD was 24 out of 736 patients (2.3 9 1000 PYs).",0

The website material describes in detail each single genetically deﬁned case and two representative cases aﬀected by idiopathic PD. Discussion",0
"AC is a relatively rare critical condition and only few studies could present data on more than 25 cases [1,5]. Although our cohort of patients was wide and intensively studied [15,16], oﬀering an outline of epidemiological distributions in an ethnically and phenomenologically homogeneous population, the rarity of the syndrome and the numerically modest results of genetic testing, probably due to underestimation of recessive and low penetrance mutations, resulted in a small number of patients, six patients aﬀected by AC out of 20 genetically identiﬁed parkinsonisms in a cohort of 756 patients followed for 10 years (Table 2). Therefore a possible criticism is that statistical inferences may be debatable. However, the striking coincidence of AC with the genetic diagnoses obtained in six patients indicates a disproportionate prevalence of this crisis in comparison with the population of PD patients. The incidence of AC in the described genetic mutation carriers (POLG1, PINK1, LRRK2, GBA) was a multiple (i.e. 21.2 vs. 3.0‰) of the known inci-",0
"dence of AC in parkinsonian populations. Moreover, AC episodes were recurrent in four out of the six patients, and all four were carriers of mutations involving mitochondrial functions: POLG1 (found in one of the four) is the gene that codes for the catalytic subunit of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase; PINK1 (three patients) is the gene encoding a mitochondrial serine/threonine protein kinase. Three of the four patients died in the last crisis.",0
"This ﬁnding suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction may represent a predisposition to AC and to its possible lethal outcome. This assumption is challenged by the occurrence of AC in a carrier of LRRK2 mutation (with lethal outcome) and in a carrier of GBA mutation, suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction cannot be the only explanation.",0
"LRRK2 is a member of the leucine-rich repeat kinase family involved in vesicular traﬃcking; expression of LRRK2 mutants in diﬀerent experimental models increases the presence of autophagic compartments [17]. However, the pathogenic gain-of-function mutant form of LRRK2, G2019S, can cause defects in the morphology and dynamics (ﬁssion) of mitochondria [18].",0
"Also in the GBA mutation (mostly leading to lysosomal storage disorders), some recent evidence showed that mitochondria were dysfunctional and fragmented, with impaired respiration and reduced respiratory chain complex, including ATP synthase, activities [19]. Therefore the main conclusion is that our ﬁndings point to mitochondrial genetically driven dysfunction as one of the most probable underlying causes of AC.",0
"It is suggested that in a cell environment where mitochondrial buﬀering power is defective, stressful conditions, such as the precipitating events described in our case cohort (infections, traumas etc.) could activate a stress cascade, altering the cellular energy state by inhibiting the electron transport chain. It is therefore suggested that the determinant factor in AC might be akin to inhibition of complex I activity, observed in brain mitochondria of rats exposed to neuroleptics [20] or in postmortem evaluations of patients aﬀected by neuroleptic malignant syndrome [21], which is a disorder similar to AC [4].",0
"In order to conﬁrm/debate the hypothesis suggested by our preliminary ﬁndings, further studies will be needed, considering wider populations, assessing all cases of AC for genetic mutations and considering the risk of underestimation of genetic mutations because of reduced penetrance or recessive inheritance. It is suggested that the construction of an observational network might answer the question asked by our report, and might help further the search for the mechanism of AC and for its treatment.

"POLG-related disease can present with varying degree of severity and timing of onset with multiple organ involvement [1]. In adulthood, POLG mutations usually present with progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO). PEO can be due to dominant or recessive mutations in POLG. Autosomal dominant PEO is associated with generalized progressive myopathy. Affected individuals may also have sensorineural deafness, ataxia, axonal neuropathy, depression, parkinsonism, cataract, and hypogonadism. Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE)-like presentations have been reported previously with autosomal recessive POLG mutations [2, 3]. Here, we describe a 38-year-old male with a novel heterozygous mutation in POLG presenting as MNGIE.",0

"MNGIE is characterized by progressive gastrointestinal dysmotility, cachexia, PEO and peripheral neuropathy [4]. It is caused by autosomal recessive mutations in TYMP gene. A MNGIE-like phenotype has also been reported in a patient with recessive mutations in RRM2B [5]. Autosomal recessive mutations in POLG presenting as MNGIE was first reported by Van Goethem et al. [2] in two sisters. Tang et al. [3] reported clinical features consistent with MNGIE in 3 of 92 patients with two pathogenic mutations in POLG. We are reporting the first patient with heterozygous POLG mutation presenting as MNGIE. This is a novel and likely to be pathogenic mutation due to characteristic clinical presentation, muscle histology, and associated multiple deletions in mitochondrial DNA in muscle biopsy. Aspartate at 890 position is evolutionally conserved from yeast to human and resides at the critical site for catalysis. Mutations at this position (D890N) in cultured human cells resulted in mitochondrial DNA depletion [6, 7]. Moreover, expression in cultured human cells suggested that this mutation may be pathogenic in heterozygous state [7]. In the absence of affected relatives, this mutation is likely a de novo dominant mutation in our patient. Like the previous",1

"patients with POLG mutations and MNGIE phenotype, our patient too had absence of leukodystrophy on brain MRI [2, 3]. Leukodystrophy is hallmark of MNGIE [8]. Although gastrointestinal dysmotility is commonly seen in mitochondrial disorders [9], the combination of severe dysmotility, cachexia, peripheral neuropathy, ophthalmoplegia, and asymptomatic leukodystrophy is suggestive of MNGIE. As many of these features are also seen in POLGrelated disorders, clinical presentation may overlap. Brain MRI revealing diffuse leukodystrophy is suggestive of MNGIE. In the absence of asymptomatic diffuse leukodystrophy, other possible etiologies, particularly POLGrelated conditions should be considered [10]. Thus, this case expands the spectrum of phenotypes linked to AD POLG mutations to include MNGIE-like presentations.",0

"proteins used either in the respiratory chain enzyme complexes or regulating the mtDNA functioning [1]. In childhood, most of the disorders occur due to mutations in the nuclear genes, inherited in autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive jmanner. Over the last decade, a growing number of syndromes associated with mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from tissue-specific depletion of mtDNA have been reported in infants [2]. MtDNA depletion syndromes are transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait, and cause respiratory chain dysfunction with prominent neurological, muscular, and hepatic involvement [3,4]. Acute hepatic failure is usually a sporadic phenomenon; mitochondrial disorders are usually not considered in diagnosis due to lack of awareness and resources to prove it. Although there are no specific pointers to mitochondrial etiology, but it should be suspected whenever there is a family history of similar occurrence or parental consanguinity. Unexplained elevated plasma lactates also provide useful clues. We report mitochondrial disorders causing acute hepatic failure in two infants.",0

The enzymology in liver revealed significant reduction in activity in complexes I and III (1%) and borderline low activity in complex IV (15%), whereas it was normal in all complexes studied (I, III and IV) in cultured skin fibroblasts.

"His metabolic workup, including screening for Galactosemia, Tyrosinemia type 1, amino acids, organic acids and fatty acid oxidation defects, was normal. Plasma lactate was elevated on several occasions. Fasting ultrasound abdomen revealed enlarged liver with increased echogenicity and partially distended gall bladder with wall edema. Spleen and kidneys were normal. His liver biopsy showed mild biliary duct proliferation, intrahepatic cholestasis, pan-lobular steatosis (micro and macrovesicular) and fibrosis. Echocardiogram revealed dilated left ventricle with normal ejection fraction. ECG was normal. Other relevant investigations are provided in Table I. Neuroimaging showed non-specific changes related to liver dysfunction and hyperammonemia. In view",0
"facilities (respiratory chain enzymology and blue native gel electrophoresis) and molecular studies. With increasing availability and feasibility of genetic testing (gene sequencing – either single or panel testing using NGS), it is now becoming possible to confirm these diagnoses – to guide for further management of the child as well as for accurate counseling and prenatal diagnosis in future pregnancies in the families. NGS helped in making diagnosis of MPV17-related mtDNA depletion syndrome in case 2, similar to reports earlier [5]. Awareness of these disorders is essential as there are no specific pointers other than raised lactate along with organ-specific dysfunction. An index of suspicion should be raised whenever any child is noted to have the constellation of symptoms of hepato-cerebral or myopathic form or even with isolated liver disease, along with positive family history or consanguinity. Accurate diagnosis can guide pedia-tricians for appropriate management and prognosis of the disease. In our cases, both children were candidates for liver transplantation, but diagnosis of mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome with multiple organ involvement led to avoidance of the transplant. The decision of avoiding transplant was based on poor outcomes (55% mortality) and progression of disease post-transplant [6]. Patients with MDS also need to be advised against valproate therapy, as it may trigger a crisis and fulminant hepatic failure in children who may not have had hepatic involvement [7,8]. Prenatal diagnosis is now feasible in future pregnancies to rule out 25% risk of recurrence in siblings.",0

"BACKGROUND: Nuclear polymerase gamma (POLG) mutations are the most common cause of inherited mitochondrial disease. POLG mutation diseases have a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations; the lethal infantile form is myocerebrohepatopathy spectrum. PATIENT: A 4-month-old boy was referred for poor feeding, emesis, failure to thrive, and hypotonia. RESULTS: Brain computed tomography was normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging with and without contrast demonstrated bilateral enhancement of cranial nerves III, V-X, and the upper and midcervical nerve roots. Liver biopsy revealed early cirrhosis, steatosis, and focal necrosis. Muscle biopsy did not demonstrate speciﬁc abnormalities of mitochondrial morphology or number. Electron transport chain analysis of both ﬁbroblasts and muscle demonstrated deﬁciencies. Because of suspected mitochondrial depletion disorder, testing was performed for mitochondrial abnormalities including analysis of the POLG gene, which revealed two pathogenic mutations, c.1399G>A (p.A467T) and c.3285C>G (p.S1095R). CONCLUSIONS: We report abnormal gadolinium enhancement of multiple cranial nerves and cervical nerve roots in an infant with myocerebrohepatopathy spectrum disease whose brain MRI otherwise revealed only mild atrophy.

3.209 kg with head circumference in the eighty-eighth percentile. Apgar scores were 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes. Newborn screening test results were negative. Perinatal course was uneventful except hyperbilirubinemia at 1 week of age treated with phototherapy. Family history was noncontributory.,1
"Examination on admission demonstrated an irritable nondysmorphic child with mild ptosis, poor head control, palpable liver edge 3 cm below the costal margin, decreased muscle mass, central hypotonia, and absent deep tendon reﬂexes. Head circumference had decreased to the thirteenth percentile. Initial laboratory tests demonstrated elevated levels of direct bilirubin 2.8 mg/dL (normal [nl] <0.6 mg/dL), indirect bilirubin",1
"1.3 mg/dL (nl, 0.1-1.0 mg/dL), aspartate aminotransferase 448 U/L (nl, 5105 U/L), alanine aminotransferase 167 U/L (nl, 7-110 U/L), and Lactate dehydrogenase 2221 U/L (nl, 600-1400 U/L). The plasma lactate level peaked at 12.3 mmol/L (nl, 0.5-2.2 mmol/L). The cerebrospinal ﬂuid protein level was 1113 mg/dL (nl, 15-45 mg/dL). An abdominal ultrasonography demonstrated gallbladder sludge. Noncontrast brain computed tomography scan was normal.",1
"The clinical phenotype of poor head control and progressive weakness of the upper extremities suggested a mitochondrial disorder and prompted a brain MRI to investigate the possibility of metabolic stroke or basal ganglia abnormalities. The MRI with and without intravenous contrast demonstrated bilateral enhancement of cranial nerves (CN) III and V-X, as well as dorsal nerve root enhancement in the visualized portion of the cervical spine (Figure A-E). Dedicated spine imaging was not performed. The MRI also revealed prominent subarachnoid spaces and ventricle size indicative of cortical and white matter atrophy (Figure F) in the setting of a small and decreasing head circumference. No additional MRI abnormalities were observed. The myelination pattern was normal for age (Figure F,G). Galactocerebrosidase and arylsulfatase",1
"A activities were normal. Testing for spinal muscular atrophy, tyrosinemia type 1, galactosemia, mitochondrial genome mutations, pyruvate disorders, Niemann-Pick disease, and peroxisomal defects were also unremarkable.",0
"Three weeks after admission, the child worsened. He developed hypoxia, ascites, tachycardia, intermittent fevers, and sepsis. Liver biopsy revealed ﬁndings of early cirrhosis, steatosis, and focal necrosis. Electron transport chain (ETC) analysis of ﬁbroblasts was consistent with complex III deﬁciency. Muscle biopsy did not demonstrate speciﬁc abnormalities of mitochondrial morphology or number. Type 1 muscle ﬁbers were predominant and shorter than expected. Some severely cytochrome oxidase-deﬁcient muscle ﬁbers were present. No mtDNA mutations or deletions were observed. However, muscle ETC analysis revealed deﬁciencies in all ETC complexes except complex II. In particular, deﬁciencies in complexes I and IV met major modiﬁed Walker criterion. Because of suspicion for a mitochondrial depletion disorder, testing to include analysis of the POLG gene revealed two pathogenic mutations, c.1399G>A (p.A467T) and c.3285C>G (p.S1095R).",1

"severe deﬁcits in functioning of the ETC complex, the facilitator of oxidative phosphorylation. All the known pathogenic mutations in the POLG gene have been compiled into a National Institutes of Health database (http://tools.niehs. nih.gov/polg/). The most common mutation responsible for POLG-associated mitochondrial disease is c.1399G>A (p.A467T), either homozygous or compound heterozygous with another mutation.1 Tang et al.2 catalogued a large series of patients with POLG mutations, and only our patient had compound heterozygosity for c.1399G>A (p.A467T) and c.3285C>G (p.S1095R). The latter has previously been reported as pathogenic, conﬁrming the clinical impression of POLG deﬁciency.1",0
"POLG mutations have a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations and age of onset. Liver, brain, and muscle are most commonly affected. At least six distinct phenotypes are recognized: (1) myocerebrohepatopathy spectrum (MCHS); (2) Alpers syndrome; (3) ataxia neuropathy spectrum; (4) myoclonus epilepsy myopathy sensory ataxia; (5) autosomal recessive progressive external opthalmoplegia; and (6) autosomal dominant progressive external opthalmoplegia.1 The MCHS phenotype describes the clinical picture of our patient (infantile presentation of hypotonia, myopathy, developmental delay, encephalopathy, and liver dysfunction) and is the form of POLG disease with the earliest age of onset.1 MCHS can be distinguished from the more common Alpers syndrome by the lack of seizures, liver pathology, and more severe myopathy.3 MCHS disease has also been attributed to other mitochondrial gene mutations, not solely POLG mutations.3",0
"Generally, infantile mitochondrial diseases have extensive white matter abnormalities including demyelination or delayed myelination, leukodystrophy, and cortical atrophy with or without gray matter nuclei abnormalities.4 Ferrari et al.3 reported a series of nine infants with POLG disease. The eight patients with Alpers syndrome had nonspeciﬁc white and gray matter MR abnormalities. One girl with a clinical picture of MCHS and multiple heterozygous POLG gene mutations presented at 3 months of age and died at 6 months. Her brain MRI was reportedly normal.",0
"Abnormal cranial nerve enhancement has not been reported in a POLG-associated mitochondrial disease. Cranial nerve enhancement has been reported along with widespread cerebral white matter abnormalities in adult mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy,5 and in childhood metabolic diseases including Krabbe disease and metachromatic leukodystrophy, both cranial nerve and cauda equina enhancement have been observed.6-9 Isolated cranial nerve enhancement signaled early infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy in one child.10",0
The mechanism behind enhancing cranial nerves has yet to be elucidated. Speculations include the breakdown of the blood-nerve barrier because of perivascular inﬂammation or inﬁltration and areas of active demyelination.6 Nerve enhancement could also originate from the cytotoxic buildup of metabolites that prevent normal myelination and facilitate demyelination in diseases such as metachromatic leukodystrophy.8,0
"Most articles describe MRI without contrast. This may explain the patient with MCHS who had a normal MRI in the study by Ferrari et al.3 Ganeson et al.7 advocated using contrast in the routine evaluation of infants with early onset of developmental delay when they identiﬁed a patient with early infantile Krabbe disease who had multiple enhancing cranial nerves along with nonspeciﬁc white matter changes at MRI. We are in agreement with Morana et al.,9 in hypothesizing that abnormal cranial nerve enhancement goes largely undetected because of the lack of administration of MRI contrast when evaluating infants.",0
"In conclusion, the differential diagnosis of abnormal cranial nerve enhancement should be expanded to include POLG mutations and, more generally, mitochondrial diseases if the appropriate clinical signs are present.

"We report on the clinical, neuropathological, and genetic ﬁndings of a Japanese case with myocerebrohepatopathy spectrum (MCHS) disorder due to polymerase gamma (POLG) mutations. A girl manifested poor sucking and failure to thrive since 4 months of age and had frequent vomiting and developmental regression at 5 months of age. She showed signiﬁcant hypotonia and hepatomegaly. Laboratory tests showed hepatocellular dysfunction and elevated protein and lactate levels in the cerebrospinal ﬂuid. Her liver function and neurologic condition exacerbated, and she died at 8 months of age. At autopsy, fatty degeneration and ﬁbrosis were observed in the liver. Neuropathological examination revealed white matter-predominant spongy changes with Alzheimer type II glia and loss of myelin. Enzyme activities of the respiratory chain complex I, III, and IV relative to citrate synthase in the muscle were normal in the biopsied muscle tissue, but they were reduced in the liver to 0%, 10%, and 14% of normal values, respectively. In the liver, the copy number of mitochondrial DNA compared to nuclear DNA was reduced to 3.3% of normal values as evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

Introduction,0
"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion syndrome (MDDS), ﬁrst described in 1991, is deﬁned as a reduction in the mtDNA copy number in diﬀerent tissues, leading to insuﬃcient synthesis of respiratory chain complexes (RCC) [1]. Clinical manifestations of MDDS involve many organ systems including the central and peripheral nervous system, liver, muscle, and gastrointestinal tract [2]. Human polymerase gamma (POLG) is the common causative gene involved in MDDS, whose mutations result in a diverse group of phenotypes, such as Alpers syndrome and myocerebrohepatopathy spectrum (MCHS) disorders, which typically show disease onset during early childhood. Further, several POLG-related phenotypes manifesting during adolescence and adulthood are recognized, including progressive external ophthalmoplegia, ataxia-neuropathy spectrum disorders, myoclonus epilepsy myopathy sensory ataxia, and sensory ataxic neuropathy with dysarthria/dysphagia and ophthalmoplegia. Some overlaps in the symptoms between these adult phenotypes exist, and can be additionally accompanied by tremor, parkinsonism, hearing loss, stroke-like episodes, and gastrointestinal symptoms, which are reminiscent of symptoms of mitochondrial diseases with pathomechanisms other than MDDS [3,4].",0
"MCHS, the most severe phenotype of POLG disorders, was recently identiﬁed and is deﬁned by the clinical triad of (1) myopathy or hypotonia, (2) developmental delay or dementia, and (3) liver dysfunction [3,5]. Severe, intractable epilepsy is included in the diagnostic hallmarks of Alpers syndrome, but is not characteristic of MCHS. As the number of patients with MCHS disorders is small and detailed clinicopathological ﬁndings are unavailable, we herein report the case of a girl with MCHS disorders due to POLG mutations. As far as we know, this is the ﬁrst Japanese case of MCHS disorders with POLG mutation.",0
"Case report A girl was born at 40 weeks of gestation to healthy non-consanguineous parents without any abnormalities. The birth weight, height, and head circumference were normative. Early development and growth were unremarkable. At 4 months of age, she developed poor weight gain, emesis, hypotonia, developmental delay, and lethargy. She was admitted to our hospital because of recurrent vomiting at 6 months of age.",1
"On admission, body length was 60.9 cm [-2.2 standard deviation (SD)], body weight was 5600 g (-2.3 SD), and head circumference was 42 cm (+0.2 SD). Hepatomegaly of a hard consistency was observed approximately 3 cm under the costal margin with no associated splenomegaly. She was alert and could establish good eye contact and smile. She showed severe hypotonia and proximal dominant muscular weakness. She could hold neither her head nor limbs up. All deep tendon reﬂexes were weak.",1
"Although complete blood count and urinalysis were unremarkable, hepatocellular dysfunction was obvious at the time of hospitalization, with the following laboratory test values: aspartate aminotransferase, 390 U/L; alanine aminotransferase, 218 U/L; total bilirubin,",1
"1.6 mg/dL; total bile acids, 172 lmol/L; c-glutamyl transpeptidase, 179 IU/L; leucine aminopeptidase, 268 IU/L; and cholinesterase, 73 IU/L. Levels of serum creatine kinase and blood glucose were normal. Cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) examination showed elevated protein levels of 304 mg/dL and normal cell count and glucose levels. Lactic acid was elevated in both plasma and CSF, at 15.9 mg/dL and 30.3 mg/dL, respectively. Pyruvic acid was normal in both plasma and CSF. Metabolic screening tests, including urine organic acids, plasma, and urine amino acids, were unremarkable. Initial brain computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging performed at 6 months of age were unremarkable. The electroencephalogram showed generalized slow wave activity. Only wave I was identiﬁable on auditory evoked potentials. Motor nerve and sensory conduction were mildly delayed.",1
Muscle biopsy ﬁndings at 6 months of age showed a variation in ﬁber type; ragged-red ﬁber was not observed. Lipid and glycogen storage were not observed. Cytochrome c oxidase staining showed normal ﬁndings. Analysis of the RCC enzyme activity revealed no abnormality. No mtDNA mutations were identiﬁed.,1
"Soon after admission, diﬃculty in feeding and vomiting aggravated, and tube feeding along with parenteral nutrition was required. She experienced bouts of diarrhea. Consciousness level decreased progressively, and myoclonic jerks of the right and left arms were infrequently observed. Follow-up CT revealed mild cerebral atrophy at 7 months of age. Hepatocellular dysfunction exacerbated progressively, and she died of multiple organ failure caused by hepatic failure at 8 months of age, despite supplementation of multiple vitamins and coenzyme Q 10, and was autopsied. Two years later, another girl was born to the parents. She had the same clinical course and laboratory ﬁndings observed in the present patient and died at 7 months of age. Valproic acid was not used in either patient.",1
"Postmortem examinations Body weight was 6.0 kg (mean ± SD, 8.0 ± 0.88 kg). The weight of the atrophic liver was 200 g, and the surface was yellowish, irregular, and hard. The lungs were congested and adrenal glands were atrophic. The other visceral organs were unremarkable on macroscopic",1
"examination. The brain weighed 760 g and showed massive edema and caudal necrosis. Microscopically, hepatocytes and adrenal cortical cells were swollen, and renal tubular cells contained phospholipids and diﬀuse foam cells. Similar foam cells were also seen in the lungs and cardiac muscle ﬁbers. In the liver, hepatic ﬁbrosis, microvesicular steatosis, and fatty degeneration were observed (Fig. 1). In the central nervous system, a spongy change was noted predominantly in the cerebral white matter, and neuronal loss in the cerebral and cerebellar cortex was mild. Alzheimer type II glia was observed in massive numbers in the cerebral and cerebellar white matter, with a smaller amount in the cerebral cortex and deep gray matter. Neuronal loss, capillary proliferation, and sponginess were prominent in the substantia nigra (Fig. 2). Recent linear necrosis was present in the bilateral caudate nucleus.",1
"Assay of respiratory chain complex enzyme activity in the liver The liver samples were immediately frozen at autopsy and stored at -70 °C. Activities of RCC I, II, III and IV were assayed as described previously [6,7]. The percentages of RCC I, II, III and IV activities relative to that of citrate synthase (CS) as a mitochondrial enzyme marker were calculated. Relative enzyme activities of RCC I, III, and IV to CS in the liver were reduced to 0%, 10%, and 14% of normal values, respectively, while that of RCC II was reduced to 29%.",1
Analysis of quantitative polymerase chain reaction of mtDNA and DNA sequence of POLG gene,0
"Written informed consent was obtained from the patient’s parents in order to perform gene analysis. The quantitative estimation of mtDNA was performed by real-time ampliﬁcation of fragments of ND1 in the mtDNA genome, as previously described [7,8]. To determine the overall abundance of mtDNA, we compared the real-time ampliﬁcation of ND1 with a single-copy nuclear reference gene (exon 24 of the CFTR gene) [7,9]. The ratio of ND1 to CFTR in the liver was reduced to 3.3% (SD, 1.2%) as compared to the control.",0

"The hetero compound mutations in POLG were not found in either of the 1000 Genomes Project Database, ESP6500 database nor HGVD, suggesting that these are pathogenic mutations. The amino acid sequences of these two sites (p.A957V and p.I1185T) are well conserved across species including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, indicating their importance (Fig. 3). In silico analyses also predicted that these two amino acid mutations are deleterious. Furthermore A957V has been reported by Tang et al. [10]. They reported A957V allele was shared in three unrelated patients and concluded this mutation is pathogenic. The pathogenic mutations in the ﬂanking region of p.1185I; p.1184D [11,12] and p.1186D [13] have been reported, suggesting this region is also important. Thus, we conclude the compound heterozygous mutations of this patient cause the disease. Alpers syndrome is deﬁned as the clinical triad of (1) refractory, mixed-type seizures that often include a focal component, (2) psychomotor regression, often triggered by intercurrent infection, and (3) hepatopathy with or without acute liver failure. There is an overlap between the phenotypes of MCHS and Alpers syndrome; however, the former usually shows an earlier onset age and more rapid disease progression, while the latter is characterized by intractable epilepsy. Using the “myo-” preﬁx in MCHS may be confusing since the pathological ﬁndings of muscles in this disorder often shows no evidence of mitochondrial myopathy; instead, the hypotonia observed in the triad can be regarded as a symptom of brain dysfunction. Thus, the clinical features of the",0
patient discussed herein were typical of MCHS.,0
"Although Wong et al. [3] “.. .excluded classical Alpers hepatopathy by liver biopsy” in MHCS, exact pathological ﬁndings were not provided by the authors. Diﬀerences in the hepatopathy observed in these two phenotypes have not been established; pathological characteristics of the liver in Alpers syndrome include ﬁbrosis, regenerative nodules, hepatocyte dropout, bile duct proliferation, fatty changes, and bile stasis [14]. The ﬁndings of the present patient were compatible with those of Alpers syndrome, similar to the case of POLG-related MDDS previously observed [15]. As for the neuropathological ﬁndings, Alpers syndrome usually shows a preferential involvement of gray matter, characterized by gliosis, nerve cell loss, spongy degeneration, and accumulation of neural lipids in the cerebral cortex [16]. Alzheimer type II glia, representing hepatic encephalopathy, was also distributed predominantly in the gray matter [17].",0
"A patient exhibiting a clinical evolution from MCHS to Alpers phenotype showed gray matter involvement and microscopic ﬁndings similar to those in Leigh syndrome [5], and brain biopsy in another Alpers patient with prominent white matter signal change revealed pathological characteristics typical of Alpers disease with intractable seizures [18]. On the other hand, marked gliosis and sponginess of the white matter without pathological changes in the cerebral cortex was observed in a patient with probable MCHS [17]. Apart from these, we could not ﬁnd any MCHS cases with a neuropathological description in the literature. The white matter-predominant spongy degeneration with Alzheimer type II astrocytosis in the present patient may therefore be characteristic of MCHS.",0
"POLG disorders often show elevated levels of lactate both in the serum and CSF as well as elevated levels of hepatic enzymes. However, these ﬁndings are not speciﬁc for POLG disorders; rather, they are hallmarks of mitochondrial disorders. Analysis of the RCC enzyme activity is the most valuable test for diagnosis of MDDS. However, RCC enzyme activity varies among muscle, liver, kidney, and brain tissues in the same patient [1,19], presumably due to the diﬀerential degree of DNA depletion among individual organs. The constituents of complex II are coded by genes in the nuclear, not mitochondrial DNA. In the present patient, the decreased complex II enzyme activity in the biopsied liver may either result from augmented activity of control CS enzyme due to an increase of mitochondria in number, or may be secondary to the damage of hepatocytes with necrotic and ﬁbrotic changes [19]. It is very important to keep in mind that morphological ﬁndings and RCC enzyme activities in the muscle are sometimes unremarkable in MCHS patients, even though they show hypotonia or muscular weakness, as in the present case [5,15,20]. Therefore, analysis of RCC enzyme activities in the liver should be considered when Alpers syndrome or MCHS disorders are suspected, even when the morphological ﬁndings of muscle or enzyme assay results are unremarkable.",0

"Mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction can cause a variety of diseases known as mitochondrial disorders. Polymerase γ (POLG) is the enzyme responsible for the replication and repair of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Pol γA, the catalytic core of the enzyme, is encoded by the nuclear POLG1 gene. Mutations of this gene are associated with multiple deletions and/or depletion of mtDNA, which may lead to impaired energy production in the mitochondria and the so-called POLG syndromes [1]. Since the discovery of the gene in 1996, more than 100 pathogenic mutations have been linked to a wide range of nonneurological and neurological disorders. Among the neurological manifestations, there is an overlapping phenotypic spectrum that may include myopathy, neuropathy, ptosis, epilepsy, muscle pain, ataxia and progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO). Although rare, cases of parkinsonism have also been described in association with POLG1 mutations. We report on a patient with parkinsonism, PEO, ptosis, and",1

Her family history was positive for external ophthalmoplegia with bilateral ptosis and behavioural disturbances in only one of her brothers. Her mother suffered repetitive abortions, but other disorders were not known in either of her parents, who were not consanguineous, as reported by the patient. She ﬁrst presented with progressive bilateral ptosis in her forties and received corrective left eyelid surgery with suboptimal outcome, refusing further interventions. She underwent bilateral cataract extraction at the age of 67. She demonstrated childish behaviour and learning difﬁculties throughout her adult life, as well as compulsive habits such as gathering items over the last twenty years. She also suffered progressive cognitive decline, with difﬁculties in performing her habitual tasks and a degree of social impairment (lack of interaction, indifference, etc.) during the past three years.

Neuropsychological tests revealed cognitive impairment with executive dysfunction, language domain impairment and mild apraxia. Serum analyses showed a total CK activity of 92 U/l (normal ≤ 169). Other serum parameters, including the levels of pyruvate, copper, ceruloplasmin, folic acid, vitamin B12 and thyroid hormones, were normal. A brain MRI scan revealed moderate enlargement of the ventricles and diffuse brain atrophy. Bilateral striatal dopamine deﬁciency, which was most marked in the left putamen, was evidenced by N-ﬂuoropropyl-2β-carbomethoxy-3β-4-[123I]iodophenyltropane SPECT. The patient was initiated on levodopa/carbidopa (300/75 mg per day), to which she exhibited a partial response (mild reduction in bradykinesia and rigidity). Electromyography and nerve conduction studies showed no abnormalities, and echocardiography revealed no signiﬁcant disturbances. A mitochondrial disorder was suspected, and a muscle biopsy of the biceps brachii demonstrated ragged red ﬁbres based on Gomori staining (Fig. 1). Southern blot hybridization analysis identiﬁed multiple mtDNA deletions that were conﬁrmed using the long-PCR technique. Given this ﬁnding, the POLG1 gene was sequenced by the standard Sanger method. Total DNA was extracted from blood following written informed consent, and using standard methods. Direct sequencing of PCR amplicons of coding exons of POLG1 was performed as described previously [2].

"We report on a case of parkinsonism, PEO, ptosis, and behavioural and cognitive abnormalities associated with a novel mutation in the POLG1 gene. In contrast to other manifestations, parkinsonism is less frequently observed in mutations of this gene. It was ﬁrst described in ﬁve families, with some members presenting levodopa-responsive parkinsonism (n = 15), cataracts, ataxia and hypoacusis in different combinations. Two previously known mutations in the POLG1 gene, as well as one novel mutation, were described in these patients.

"and ptosis appeared in her 3rd decade, and a second one in which obsessive disorder developed some years later, followed by cognitive decline and parkinsonism, in her 6th decade. It has to be admitted that although all these clinical manifestations can be explained by the genetic variant we report, the lack of genetic study in the sibling with a similar clinical picture or in any other relative (she only has a healthy sister who has declined to be studied) impedes to assess the segregation of this clinical picture. In addition, parkinsonism could be a coexisting condition, particularly if we consider the prevalence of this entity at the age of our patient. Be that as it may, similarly to the patient we describe, it has to be noticed that in contrast to typical PD, parkinsonism associated with POLG1 mutations has additional features, accounting for a more complex clinical phenotype and departing from a diagnosis of PD. On this regard, cognitive impairment is a particularly interesting feature as it is observed in other mitochondrial disorders [21,22], suggesting that the complexity of its pathogenesis extends beyond the dopaminergic system.",0
"Although the exact mechanism by which mitochondrial dysfunction leads to parkinsonism is not clearly understood, accumulating evidence suggests that it plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine and rotenone, inhibitors of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I, have been reported to cause parkinsonism in humans and other primates [23]. Furthermore, several of the genes causative of familial forms of PD are involved in mitochondrial function, including Pink1, parkin and DJ-1 [23]. In addition, mtDNA deletions have been shown in substantia nigra (SN) neurons of PD patients, suggesting that this may be a predisposing factor to the death of these dopaminergic neurons, which are believed to be more vulnerable to mitochondrial dysfunction than other types of neurons [24]. The extent to which POLG1 variants may play a role in the pathogenesis of PD is not well established, but it has been shown that among 441 cases of early onset PD, two cases carried compound heterozygous mutations and the frequency of affected siblings was higher in patients carrying heterozygous POLG1 mutations [19]. In addition, rare variants of the POLG1 CAG-repeat (non-10/11Q variants) in the exon 2 which encodes a polyglutamine tract, are more frequent in PD patients than in controls",0

"Human Pol γ is a heterotrimer comprising a catalytic subunit, Pol γA, and a dimer of an accessory subunit, Pol γB. Pol γA is a 140-kDa polypeptide which has three major domains: a N-terminal Exo domain (which contains the exo active site), a C-terminal Pol domain (which contains the pol active site), and a spacer domain (which separates the Exo and Pol domains in primary sequence). The clinical phenotype of POLG1 mutations depends on the severity of the resultant Pol γ functional defect and the zygosity of the nucleotide variant. A ﬁve-cluster model of Pol γ based on functional aspects has recently been designed, and is capable of predicting the pathogenic potential and biochemical defects of novel mutations [30]. According to this model, the novel mutation reported here (p.His945Leu change) is placed in subcluster 1E",0
"(residues 914–966), which acts to bind the correct deoxynucleotide tri- phosphate substrate (dNTP). Within this region there is a motif known as the Pol B motif (residues 943–958) which establishes speciﬁc contacts with correctly base-paired dNTP in the closed conformation. Mutations at this level disrupt the speciﬁc contacts with the incoming dNTP and reduce the ﬁdelity without affecting DNA binding afﬁnity. Accordingly, mutations at this site are capable of competing for dNTP binding with wild-type Pol γ but are unable to polymerize nucleotides effectively, causing mtDNA damage [30].",0
"Conclusion We report on a novel mutation in the POLG1 gene which leads to an amino acid change, p.His945Leu, associated with parkinsonism accompanied by a nigro-striatal dopaminergic deﬁcit and response to levodopa, cognitive disturbances, obsessive disorder, PEO and ptosis. POLG1 gene mutations should therefore be considered in cases of parkinsonism that display these characteristics. Conﬂict of interest The authors declare that they do not have any conﬂict of interest.

"Human ovarian dysfunction comprises a variety of different conditions that each result in irregular menstrual cycles, ovarian failure, and female infertility. Amenorrhea and irregular menstrual cycles are two main features of ovarian dysfunction. Genetic defects can cause ovarian dysfunction, including chromosomal abnormalities and single gene alterations1–7. Mutations in STAG3, BMP15, FSHR, GDF9, NOBOX, MCM8,",0
"MCM9, NUP107, MSH4, CSB-PGBD3 and MSH5 can cause recessive primary amenorrhea8–17 or secondary amenorrhea18–20. Sequence variants in POLG, NR5A1, KHDRBS1, and NOBOX are reported to be associated with dominant primary21 or secondary amenorrhea22–24. In our clinical practice, some patients exhibit irregular menstrual cycles and poor outcomes of in vitro fertilization, but there is a lack of knowledge of the potential genetic contribution to this ovarian dysfunction. In this study, we examined a patient from a consanguin-",0
"eous family exhibiting irregular menstrual cycles and abnormal oocytes. Using whole-exome sequencing technology, we identified a novel homozygous POLG mutation in this patient. In contrast to previously reported heterozygous POLG mutations associated with premature ovarian failure (POF), this is the first recessive mode of inheritance of a POLG mutation in a patient with ovarian dysfunction. Materials and methods Patient",1
"A Chinese patient with ovarian dysfunction was recruited from The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, and was from a consanguineous family (Figure 1A). The patient did not show any of the following: karyotypic abnormalities, autoimmune disorders, history of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, or pelvic surgery. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Anhui Medical University. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient and her parents, and 5 ml of peripheral blood was collected from the patient.",1

"Exome sequence capture was performed using the SureSelect Human All Exon V5 Kit (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The captured libraries were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 Sequencer. Sequence reads were mapped against a human reference genome (hg19) using the BurrowsWheeler Aligner algorithm (http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/). The SNPs and Indels were detected by SAMtools (http://samtools.sourceforge.net/). Sanger sequencing was performed using gene-specific primers. Results Clinical characterization",0
"The proband (II-1, Figure 1A) was diagnosed with ovarian dysfunction and infertility at 32 years of age in 2017. Her height was 160 cm and weight was 60 kg. She experienced menarche at 15 years of age. Her menstrual cycle was irregular from 24 years of age, when she had a cycle length of approximately 4 months. Both ovaries were not clearly detected by transvaginal color Doppler ultrasound at the first-time consultancy. Circulating hormone levels of the proband were: 10.48 IU/l follicle stimulating hormone (FSH);",1
"2.77 IU/l luteinizing hormone (LH); 2.07 nmol/l testosterone; 54 pmol/l estradiol (E2); 10.03 ng/ml prolactin; and 0.05 ng/ml anti-Mu€llerian hormone (AMH). Magnetic resonance imaging showed the pituitary was normal. Examination revealed no progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), sensory ataxic neuropathy dysarthria, ophthalmoparesis, mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 4A, Leigh syndrome, or spinocerebellar ataxia with epilepsy. The proband’s mother (I-2) underwent menopause at the age of 54.",0
"To adjust the menstrual cycle and improve ovarian function, this patient had undergone 3 years of irregular hormone replacement therapy. Prior to ovarian stimulation in our hospital, 3 months of androgen supplement (dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) 25 mg three times a day) and regular hormone therapy (oral contraceptive: ethinylestradiol and cyproterone acetate tablets (Diane-35); for 21 days of each month) were used as an intervention method. Hormone levels were measured in duplicate: 7.46 IU/l FSH; 1.12 IU/l LH; and 33.43 pmol/l E2. No follicular development was detected in the subsequent three cycles using letrozole tablets (Furui; Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceutical Co, Lianyungang, China). The patient then received a constantly adjusted injection dose of menotropins (hMG; Lizhu Pharmaceutical Co, Zhuhai, China) but produced only one oocyte. Details and endpoints of the treatment are shown in Table 1.",0
"The pretreatment with DHEA and hormone replacement lowered the circulating FSH level, improved the ovarian sensitivity to FSH and increased the opportunity for oocyte development. The long stimulation lasted for about 1 month; one follicle about 20 x 17 mm could be detected on the left ovary. The only oocyte was retrieved from the left ovary by transvaginal ultrasound-guided puncture, approximately 36 h after induction of ovulation with 5000 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG; Lizhu Pharmaceutical Co.). After denuding the oocyte from surrounding granular cells using hyaluronidase, the abnormal presence of two polar bodies and granular cytoplasm (Figure 1B) indicated poor oocyte quality. Despite the aberrant morphology, the oocyte underwent intracytoplasmic sperm injection in vitro, but displayed complete fertilization failure.",0
Molecular genetic analysis,0
"Whole-exome sequencing with aligned sequence reads variant identification were performed, as previously described23. Pedigree analysis suggested an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance associated with this family (Figure 1A). We filtered out polymorphisms with allele frequencies >1% in The Short Genetic Variations database (dbSNP), 1000 Genomes (1000G), Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC), and Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) databases. A list of genes harboring coding/splicing homozygous variants were further filtered by the functional impact of the mutation (e.g. conservation and functional prediction by in silico prediction modules PolyPhen2, SIFT, and Mutationtaster).",0
"One homozygous POLG mutation (NM_002693:exon18: c.2890C > T: p.R964C) passed the filtering steps. This mutation was segregated within the family (Figure 2A). The POLG gene encodes a DNA polymerase-c involved in the replication of human mitochondrial DNA25. Mutations in POLG can cause POF or premature menopause, and all cases to date showed dominant inheritance22,26–28. Our study found the first POLG homozygous mutation in a patient with ovarian dysfunction. In silico analysis by five online prediction tools suggested that the p.R964C mutation was pathogenic CLIMACTERIC 469",1

Red arrow points to the R964 site in human POLG.",0
"(Table 2). The mutation was also predicted a high risk for pathogenicity using the POLG Pathogenicity Prediction Server (http://polg.bmb.msu.edu/query.php). Amino acid R964 is located in the polymerase domain of POLG, and is highly conserved among different species ranging from human to zebrafish (Figure 2B), suggesting the functional importance of the R964 site. Discussion",0
"In this study, we report that a novel homozygous POLG mutation is associated with ovarian dysfunction in a patient with consanguineous pedigree. The POLG gene encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase-c involved in the replication of mitochondrial DNA25. Polg knock-out mice develop an mtDNA mutator phenotype associated with reduced",0
"lifespan, premature onset of aging-related phenotypes and reduced fertility29. Dominant or recessive mutations in human POLG can cause a spectrum of disorders associated with mitochondria dysfunction, including PEO, sensory ataxic neuropathy, familial Parkinsonism and progressive sclerosing poliodystrophy30–32. Most women with PEO exhibit early menopause26. The heterozygous p.Y955C, p.R943H, p.Y831C and p.S511N mutations of POLG can segregate with POF and PEO22,26,28,33,34. In addition, another heterozygous p.Y951N mutation in POLG was found in a patient with cataracts, early-onset distal muscle weakness and atrophy, ovarian dysgenesis (a severe form of POF) and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria27. Another study screened POLG mutations in 201 patients with spontaneous primary ovarian insufficiency and found one heterozygous p.R953C variant in a patient35. Therefore, POLG heterozygous mutations, including p.S511N, p.Y831C, p.R943H, p.Y951N, p.R953C, and p.Y955C, may be associated with syndromic or non-syndromic ovarian failure.",0
Previous studies have identified dominant POLG mutations,0
"in patients with ovarian failure. However, using pedigree and WES analysis, we have found the first homozygous POLG mutation in a patient with non-syndromic ovarian dysfunction, suggesting a recessive mode of mutation inheritance. The functional difference between the p.R964C mutation and previously reported heterozygous POLG mutations remains to be determined. However, as our reported case manifested as a non-syndromic ovarian dysfunction phenotype (a mild form compared with POF), we speculate that p.R964C produces a milder functional defect in POLG activity than the six abovementioned mutations. Further experiments are required to directly examine this proposal.",1
"Our study demonstrates, for the first time, that a novel biallelic POLG mutation (p.R964C) may cause ovarian dysfunction. This study expands our understanding of POLG mutations related to ovarian dysfunction, and the mode of inheritance of certain sequence variants. The information provided by this study may also assist in future genetic counseling and precision medicine approaches. Authors’ contributions",0

"Abstract Progressive ataxia with palatal tremor (PAPT) is a syndrome caused by cerebellar and brainstem lesions involving the dentato-rubro-olivary tract and associated with hypertrophic olivary degeneration. Etiologies include acquired posterior fossa lesions (e.g. tumors, superficial siderosis, and inflammatory diseases) and genetic disorders, such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and polymerase gamma (POLG) mutations. We describe the case of a 52-yearold man who developed pure progressive ataxia and palatal tremor. Genetic analysis has shown that he is compound heterozygote for a known pathogenic (W748S) and a novel POLG variant (I1185N). Patients with POLG recessive mutations usually manifest a more complex clinical picture, including polyneuropathy and epilepsy; our case emphasizes the",1

"Progressive ataxia with palatal tremor (PAPT) is caused by cerebellar and brainstem lesions involving the dentatorubro-olivary tract, also referred to as Guillain-Mollaret triangle, resulting in characteristic hypertrophic olivary degeneration. Etiologies include acquired posterior fossa lesions (such as tumors, superficial siderosis, and inflammatory diseases) and genetic disorders [1]. Cases have been described with pathogenic variants in GFAP (OMIM 137780, adult-onset Alexander’s disease), in SURF1 (OMIM 185620), and polymerase gamma (POLG) (OMIM 174763). When linked to these latter genes, PAPT is usually part of a wider clinical picture, including extensive neurological symptoms and/or hepatic abnormalities, which are due to mitochondrial dysfunction [2, 3].",0
"Case Report A 52-year-old male patient, treated for hypertension and diabetes, presented to our neurology division in 2013 because of progressive gait and balance difficulties since two years. One year later, he started complaining of audible ear click and oscillopsia. On neurological examination, he had pendular vertical nystagmus, dysarthria, kinetic and static ataxia with severe postural instability, as well as palatal tremor (as shown 830 Cerebellum (2016) 15:829–831",1
"in Video 1). He became wheelchair-bound within 4 years after the first symptoms. He had no visual or hearing loss, neither signs of ophthalmoparesis, peripheral neuropathy, proprioceptive deficit, myopathy, epileptic activity, or cognitive decline. Family history was unremarkable on the maternal side and unknown on the paternal side. The mother of the patient died at the age of 86 without evidence of neurologic disease. As palatal tremor was not bothering him, no symptomatic treatment has been introduced.",1
"Brain MRI was performed in 2012 and showed cerebellar white matter signal abnormalities along with atrophy and bilateral T2 hyperintense enlarged olives (see Fig. 1). Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was normal, including immunoelectrophoresis and PCR for T. whipplei . Paraneoplastic antineuronal antibodies were negative, and total body PET-CT did not detect any tumor. Routine EEG and nerve conduction studies (electroneuromyography) were normal. A search for pathogenic mutations in the GFAP gene was negative. Mutations in the POLG gene were suspected because of progressive ataxia and the above-mentioned MRI findings. Similar MRI abnormalities have already been described in the literature in patients with POLG mutations [4, 5].",1
Results We performed Sanger sequencing of the coding regions and splice sites of POLG (NM_002693.2) and found a compound heterozygous state for mutations c.2243G>C:p.Trp748Ser (W748S) and c.3554T>A:p.Ile1185Asn (I1185N). The W748S variant is described as one of the most frequent POLG pathogenic mutations in the European population with a minimal allele frequency of approximately 0.1 %. The I1185N,1
"variant (not found in ExAC Browser, Exome Aggregation Consortium, http://exac.broadinstitute.org/) is predicted to be damaging (Polyphen-2, SIFT, MutationTaster) and lies in a highly conserved position, where another mutation c.3554T>C:p.Ile1185Thr (I1185T) has been recently published [6]. Familial segregation analysis suggests that the two variants are located in trans, as the maternal half brother of the patient carries only the I1185N variant. Discussion",0
"POLG mutations can lead to a multitude of clinical manifestations, constituting the broad phenotypical spectrum of the so-called POLG-related disorders [1, 7]: Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome, childhood myocerebrohepatopathy, autosomal dominant and recessive progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), and ataxia neuropathy syndrome (ANS) further subdivided to sensory ataxia, neuropathy, dysarthria, ophthalmoplegia (SANDO) and mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndrome (MIRAS).",0
"Our patient is compound heterozygote for one known pathogenic POLG variant, the W748S, and a novel likely pathogenic variant, the I1185N. I1185N occurs at the same position as the recently reported I1185T in a case of childhood myocerebrohepatopathy spectrum disorder [6]. Moreover, other pathogenic variants, such as c.3550G>A:p.Asp1184Asn (D1184N), c.3550G>C:p.Asp1184Leu (D1184L), and",1

"The patient we report is manifesting a pure PAPT syndrome. Within the POLG-related disorders, his clinical picture mostly resembles MIRAS, yet the lack of neuropathy and epilepsy along with the late onset is atypical. Moreover, palatal tremor does not seem to be commonly associated to MIRAS, since it was not described in a series of 27 MIRAS patients [9]. In a small series of hypertrophic olivary degeneration, Kinghorn et al. [3] reported two patients with compound heterozygous POLG mutations, both of which had more complex phenotypes than our patient: one had SANDO, the other suffered from ophthalmoplegia, myopathy, and neuropathy. Our case emphasizes the need to consider POLG screening in a pure, seemingly sporadic PAPT syndrome.",0

"The hereditary ataxias are classiﬁed according to their causative genes and inheritance patterns (i.e. autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, x-linked, or mitochondrial).

However, a deﬁnitive diagnosis relies on molecular genetic testing.7 Occasionally, as in the ataxia-neuropathy spectrum related to POLG mutation, characteristic MRI ﬁndings strongly suggest the diagnosis of ataxia-neuropathy.

"Pathological CGG expansions in exon 1 of the FMR1 cause three different phenotypes: fragile X syndrome, fragile X tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), and FMR1-related primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). Mutations in the catalytic subunit of mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (POLG) are the most common cause of mitochondrial disease [1]. Hyperintensities in the middle cerebellar peduncles (MCP) on T2 sequences are called the MCP sign. Late-onset ataxia and the MCP sign constitute major diagnostic criteria for definite FXTAS [2]. The MCP sign is present in up to 60 % of FXTAS patients and considered to reflect gliosis [2]. Similar abnormalities occur in other hereditary ataxia disorders and in multiple system atrophy (MSA). Here, we describe the course of disease in a man affected by POLG-associated ataxia (POLG-A) presenting as a FXTAS phenocopy syndrome. The overlapping features of POLG-A and FXTAS are highlighted.",0
"Case description Informed consent was obtained from the patient. A 60-yearold Swedish male born to non-consanguineous parents, was evaluated at our center due to progressive balance difficulties, impaired gait and coordination, slurred speech, diplopia, and hypoacusis. Insidious cognitive decline was also reported at",1
"the time of motor onset. The age at onset was 48 years. His past medical history consisted of esophoria. Examination at age 55 with the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) yielded 10 points; 5 years later, it was 15. Upon exam, signs of both cerebellar and sensory ataxia (positive Romberg’s sign) as well as chorea, myoclonus, areflexia, and complete loss of vibration sense were found. Over time, he has developed bradykinesia and marked postural instability; he requires the use of walking sticks for most of the time. His latest inventory of non-ataxia symptoms (INAS) count was 5 and his Unified Parkinson’s disease rating scale (UPDRS) part III score was 19 points. Eye examination revealed broken up smooth pursuit, nystagmus, mild dysconjugation of lateral eye movements, hypometric saccades and partial restriction of vertical gaze. Psychometric evaluation revealed deficits in information processing speed, working memory, attention, and visuospatial skills. A mild sensorineuronal hearing loss was found and the subject was recommended hearing devices. Brain MRI at age 57 displayed the MCP sign, a mega cisterna magna but no evidence of cerebellar atrophy (Fig. 1). FXTAS was suspected; however, a normal CGG expansion size, 21 repeats, was found in the FMR1 gene. Trinucleotide expansions causing Friedreich ataxia, DRPLA, SCA1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 were also ruled out. A sensory axonal polyneuropathy was found on electroneurography (ENeG). A muscle biopsy revealed variation of fiber size and lack of COX activity in some",1
"muscle fibers. In addition, reduced activity was found in complex I of the respiratory chain raising then the suspicion of a mitochondrial disorder. The homozygous mutation c.2243G > C (p.W748S) in the POLG gene was identified, MLPA analysis of this gene was normal.",1
"A younger sibling was affected by an ataxia syndrome, her age at onset was 19 years and the total disease duration was 30 years. In contrast to our patient, she had epilepsy, her imaging studies were not possible to retrieve for review. In the course of her disease, she suffered from polyneuropathy, nystagmus, vertical ophthalmoparesis, involuntary movements, and cognitive decline. The exact character of her hyperkinesias was not stated in available chart notes. She became wheelchair bound and died of pneumonia at age 49. Discussion",0
"This patient we describe met the major clinical and radiological diagnostic criteria for definite FXTAS. However, he was found to be affected by POLG-A. Varying degrees of cerebelllar hyperintensities occur in 38 % of POLG-A patients [3]. As in our case, absence of cerebellar atrophy has been reported in up to 31 % of POLG-A subjects [3]. Ataxia, cognitive decline and varying degrees of polyneuropathy occur in both POLG-A and FXTAS. Sensory axonal polyneuropathy is very common in subjects with POLG mutations [1, 3]",1

"whereas large-fiber sensory polyneuropathy occurs in FXTAS [4]. Evidence of sensory neuronopathy also exist in FXTAS [5]. An unusual feature in our case is the presence of parkinsonism, which is rather rare among subjects with POLG mutations in the absence of progressive external opthalmoplegia (PEO) [6] but is more common in FXTAS with prevalence ranging between 24 and 67 % [5, 7, 8]. Hearing loss is common in mitochondrial disorders and in FXTAS; it has been reported in 50 % of FXTAS patients [8] and in 31 % of POLGA patients [3]. Interestingly, premature ovarian failure, commonly seen in FMR1 premutation carriers, has also been described in POLG-associated ataxia [9, 10]. Thus, the overlap between POLG mutations and FMR1-associated syndromes is striking. There are however differences, for instance the manifestations of POLG mutations are protean and include features unseen in FXTAS (epilepsy, myopathy, liver failure, PEO, and /or encephalopathy), with onsets ranging from early infancy to late adulthood and the presence of hyperkinetic features like chorea and/or myoclonus [1, 3]. Dystonia occurs also in POLG mutations [3] but seems to be very rare in FXTAS [8].",1
"There are no specific radiological abnormalities for POLGassociated ataxia; however, white matter abnormalities (WMA) in the cerebellum are common [3]. In the present case, the abnormal muscle biopsy contributed to raise the suspicion of a mitochondrial disorder. However, muscle biopsies in subjects with POLG mutations are normal in most cases [11]. There are no specific biochemical analyses for POLGataxia and analysis of respiratory chain enzymes can also be normal [11, 12]. In summary, the diagnosis of POLG-ataxia requires a high index of suspicion.",0
"The pattern of inheritance of POLG mutations is complex; in most cases, it is autosomal recessive and less often autosomal dominant [1, 9]. W748S is one the most common autosomal recessive POLG mutations [1]. Of note, there is increasing evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in FXTAS [13].",0
"E. Apartis et al. proposed a revision of the diagnostic criteria for FXTAS [5] based on the fact that hyperintensities of the corpus callosum were more common than the MCP sign (68 %, respectively, 64 %) and for the fairly common presence of polyneuropathy (81 %). Other conditions with MCP hyperintensities include MSA [14], adult-onset leukoencephalopathies [15], cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), and mitochondrial disorders like PEO and infantile onset spinocerebellar ataxia (IOSCA) [16]. Taking both radiological and clinical features into consideration, late-onset POLG-A is the disease that resembles FXTAS in many features, yet external ophthalmoplegia might be a characteristic feature that—if present—clearly distinguishes POLG-A from FXTAS [17].",0

"This previously healthy 16-year-old female patient with normal psychomotor development was admitted in December 2014 because of a de novo status epilepticus. She had influenza-like symptoms 3 weeks ago and reported a 1-week history of unusual headaches with visual disturbances (flashing lights). Electroencephalogram (EEG) demonstrated continuous rhythmic (1–1.5 Hz) high amplitude delta with superimposed spikes which over the parieto-occipital regions. Brain MRI showed hyperintensities in T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted sequences: in the right thalamus, right occipital cortex and left cerebellum, without gadoliniumenhancement. Comprehensive workup including extensive autoimmune laboratory tests was normal, as well as the tests for HIV, syphilis, EBV, CMV, HSV, HZV and Borrelia burgdorferi. Lumbar puncture revealed a lymphocytic pleocytosis (16 cells/lL) without oligoclonal bands, cerebrospinal fluid culture was sterile. Whole-body computed tomography was normal. Due to a refractory status epilepticus, valproic acid (VPA) was administrated improving EEG and clinical status.",1
"In April 2015, while she remains free of seizures, systematic blood tests revealed progressive liver failure with repeated hypoglycaemias leading to urgent liver transplantation despite VPA discontinuation. Serum markers of autoimmune and viral hepatitis were negative. Wilson disease was considered because of a low ceruloplasmin and copper levels but was finally ruled out. Histopathological study of liver showed a marked necrosis with diffuse fibrosis around central veins and focal accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Microvesicular steatosis was also observed but there was no iron overload.",1

"A few days later, she developed neurological deterioration with tetraparesis, hypotonia, cognitive impairment and multifocal myoclonus. Refractory partial seizures required levetiracetam, clonazepam and topiramate to obtain seizure control. Brain MRI follow-up demonstrated new T2/FLAIR hyperintensities arguing for metabolic lesions (bilateral cerebellum, right frontal cortex and bilateral parietal cortex) associated with post-seizure hypersignals in thalami (Fig. 1a–d). Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging showed a lactate doublet peak. Mitochondriopathy was considered. Laboratory findings showed elevated lactate concentration (8 mmol/L) but analysis of respiratory chain complexes in muscle biopsy was negative. AHS was suspected and mutation analysis of the polymerase gamma gene (POLG) revealed compound heterozygotes mutations A467T/W748S. Family history did not provide any evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction, especially in her two old brothers. At 1 year of follow-up, she has severe disability requiring constant nursing care and attention. Recurrence of simple partial status epilepticus required adding lacosamide to achieve a seizure-free status.",1

"AHS is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA POLG and is associated with high and early mortality since death usually occurs within 4 years when revealed by seizures [1]. Onset is far more common in infancy or early childhood (range 3 months to 8 years), whereas juvenile or young adult-onset is rare, as we found few reported cases with a range of 10–27 years at clinical presentation [1, 2]. All patients are healthy before they developed a rapid-onset of intractable epilepsy, usually associated with headache, followed by liver failure and developmental regression. Clinical course is always fatal within years and sometimes rapidly fulminant [1]. As AHS is an autosomal recessive disorder, the inheritance of two pathogenic alleles (mutations in trans) of POLG is required for disease expression [1, 3]. Although segregation of the two mutations in POLG within the family of our patient was not done and we cannot thus validate that the mutations found are in trans, these mutations are most likely found in trans and therefore pathological [1, 4].",0
"Homozygous mutations are associated with a later onset and less severe disease, whereas patients with heterozygous mutations have an early onset, a more severe disease including an increased incidence of liver failure [1, 5]. The presence of heterozygous mutations in our patient, who presents a severe disease with late onset, demonstrates that genotype is not sufficient to explain the phenotypic variability. Environmental factors are probably involved, as viral illness can precipitate onset of AHS, whereas exposure to VPA can promote liver failure, which is a typical feature of AHS [1]. As liver dysfunction is one of the two leading causes of death in AHS, the other one is uncontrolled seizures, VPA must be strongly contraindicated in this disorder. Although the risk of VPA-induced toxicity is intrinsically related to POLG mutation, the mechanisms leading to high risk of VPA-induced hepatotoxicity are not fully understood. [6]",0
"The MRI abnormalities observed in our patient are consistent with the predominant and progressive involvement of occipital regions and cerebellum previously described in AHS [7]. In conclusion, POLG gene testing should be considered in teenagers-young adults with sudden-onset of refractory epilepsy of unknown origin before instituting VPA therapy, especially when MRI reveals brain changes in regions suggestive of a mitochondriopathy. Although there is currently no specific therapy for AHS, recognition of the diagnosis is also of importance for genetic counselling.",0

"In patients with a triad of sensory ataxic neuropathy, dysarthria, and ophthalmoparesis (SANDO), the presenting features are mainly ataxia or ptosis. SANDO patients often have impaired balance and gait, which is not surprising considering the combination of sensory ataxic neuropathy, and additional symptoms like cerebellar ataxia and limb girdle weakness. We describe a SANDO patient who noticed an increasingly impaired balance and gait, without any dizziness. Neurological investigation revealed an external ophthalmeplegia and a cerebellar ataxia; the head impulse test was not reliable because of eye movement disorders. The caloric reflex tests showed lack of responses on both sides, compatible with severe bilateral vestibulopathy. Making the diagnosis of bilateral vestibulopathy in SANDO patients may have implications for the management of the patient, because specific vestibular rehabilitation can improve gaze and postural stability.",0
"Key Words: SANDO, bilateral vestibulopathy, balance, ataxia ( J Clin Neuromusc Dis 2016;18:34–36) INTRODUCTION In 1997, 4 patients were described with a triad of sensory ataxic neuropathy, dysarthria, and ophthalmoparesis (SANDO), which has long been considered as part of the chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) spectrum.1 However, a recent study showed that the combination of progressive external ophthalmoparesis and sensory ataxic neuropathy (SAN) is associated with a specific genetic profile. Compared to",0
"CPEO patients without SAN, SANDO patients have a much higher frequency of multiple mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions.2 Multiple mtDNA deletions are generally caused by mutations in mtDNA maintenance genes, in the case of SANDO mostly in the polymerase gamma 1 (POLG) and Twinkle helicase (C10orf2) genes. Because of this specific genetic profile, SANDO is increasingly being recognized as a distinctive mitochondrial phenotype. The presenting features in SANDO are",0
"mainly ataxia (67%) or ptosis (24%).2 Mean age at onset is 32 years, though the range is considerable (5–73 years). In addition to the 3 key clinical features making up the acronym, additional symptoms include cerebellar ataxia, limb girdle weakness, diabetes, seizures, cognitive impairment, and dysphagia.",0
"SANDO patients often have impaired balance and gait, which is not surprising considering the combination of SAN, cerebellar ataxia, and limb girdle weakness. In our personal experience however, gait and balance are more profoundly impaired than in patients with similar degrees of neuropathy, ataxia, or muscle weakness.3,4 In this report we describe a SANDO patient with severe bilateral vestibular loss. We hypothesize that in this particular patient, bilateral vestibular loss might have aggravated the already impaired balance and gait. Balance and Gait Disturbances in SANDO Journal of 35",0
"CASE REPORT A 54-year-old man first noted ptosis at the age of 34. Over the years he developed several other symptoms including an external ophthalmoplegia, generalized mild muscle weakness, a length-dependent sensory deficit, areflexia, and mild cerebellar ataxia. Hearing and visual acuity remained unaffected.",1
"Several investigations had been performed in the years following the first presentation. Electromyogram revealed absence of sensory response in both arms and legs and neurogenic motor units, more profoundly in distal than in proximal muscles. Head magnetic resonance imaging showed both cerebellar and cerebral atrophy. Electrocardiograms were always normal.",1
"At age of 36 a muscle biopsy was taken from the right quadriceps. Muscle histology was unremarkable. Assessment of the mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes revealed a moderately decreased complex III activity (68% of the lower normal limit), and a complex I activity around the lowest reference value, whereas complex II and citrate synthase activities were well above the mean of the reference value.5,6 Genetic investigations revealed multiple mtDNA deletions, which were associated with 2 compound heterozygous mutations c.1399 G . A (p.Ala467Thr) and c.2243 G . C (p.Trp748Ser) in the POLG gene (NM_002693). This combination of mutations has been described before in SANDO patients.2,7",1
"Two years ago, at the age of 52, the patient noticed increasingly impaired balance and gait, without any dizziness. During fast movements he experienced a blurred vision. He had never been treated with ototoxic medication, aminoglycosides in particular, nor was he using any other medication. Neurological examination revealed a ptosis on both sides. Eye movements were restricted in horizontal plane; the head impulse test was not reliable because of eye movement disorders. Diffuse weakness was noted in arms and legs; distal sensation in",1
"arms and legs was reduced, areflexia was present. There was an uncertainty in walking; Romberg was positive. All other coordination tests were intact. An audiogram was normal for his age. A new head magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the previous findings of generalized cerebral and cerebellar atrophy, without any abnormalities in the cerebellopontine region. The caloric reflex tests showed lack of responses on both sides, compatible with severe bilateral vestibulopathy(BV). Vestibular rehabilitation has been started, with little improvement so far. DISCUSSION",1
"BV is defined as a bilateral loss of the labyrinthine function and/or the superior vestibular nerve, and might be caused by ototoxic medication (aminoglycosides in particular), Meniere’s disease, and several neurodegenerative disorders. To our knowledge, this is the first report of BV in a patient with SANDO, or more specifically, in a patient with a genetic defect in POLG.",0
"The clinical presentation of BV can vary significantly. Almost all patients experience decreased gait, especially in the dark or on uneven surfaces. Patients complain about blurred vision during fast head movements (oscillopsia), and sometimes about dizziness during fast head movements as well. Finally, patients might experience difficulties with spatial orientation. Dizziness and ear symptoms are less common. Gait is often impaired and patients are generally unable to perform tandem gait. The head impulse test is abnormal in half of the cases. A quarter of BV patients have signs of polyneuropathy and/or cerebellar dysfunction.8",0
"BV is a symptom rather than a disease. No cause can be found in half of the patients.9,10 The prevalence of BV is low, and thus there is often a long diagnostic delay. The course depends mainly on the underlying disease. The workup of a suspected BV requires caloric and rotatory chair tests. The former CLINICAL NEUROMUSCULAR DISEASE Volume 18, Number 1 September 2016 www.jcnmd.com 36 Journal of van Leeuwen et al CLINICAL NEUROMUSCULAR DISEASE Volume 18, Number 1 September 2016",0
"reveals vestibular hypofunction or areflexia on both sides, the latter, absence of postrotatory nystagmus after the chair is suddenly stopped. As in unilateral vestibular loss, vestibular rehabilitation is the treatment of choice in BV.11,12 Improved gaze and postural stability is reported in 35%–50%.",0
"In our patient the diagnosis of BV was made more than 20 years after disease onset. One possible explanation is that BV did not develop until late in the course of the disease. However, there is also a possibility that BV had gone unnoticed, because impaired balance and gait may very well have been attributed to other symptoms such as SAN, ataxia, and muscle weakness. This raises the question as to whether the association between BV and SANDO in our patient is coincidental, or that BV is yet another symptom of the already expanding phenotype of POLG mutations.",0
"In favor of a causal relationship is the fact that vestibular dysfunctions have previously been associated with other mitochondrial disorders, more particular in some of the patients carrying the mtDNA mutation m.3243A./G or the m.1555A./G mutation. The m.3243A . G mutation is associated with mitochondrial phenotypes such as mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes, maternally inherited diabetes and deafness, CPEO, Leigh syndrome, focal segmental glomerolosclerosis, and a variety of overlap syndromes. Moreover, the m.3243A./G mutations is associated with dysfunction of both the superior and inferior vestibular systems.13 The m.1555A . G mutation is associated with aminoglycoside induced deafness and vestibular loss. However, there are also reports of patients carrying the m.1555A . G mutation with saccular and inferior vestibular nerve dysfunction, despite never having been exposed to aminoglycosides.14",0
"In conclusion, this is the first report of BV in a patient with SANDO caused by POLG mutations. Making the diagnosis of BV in SANDO patients may have implications for the management of the patient, because specific vestibular rehabilitation can improve gaze and postural stability.

"Human ovarian dysfunction comprises a variety of different conditions that each result in irregular menstrual cycles, ovarian failure, and female infertility. Amenorrhea and irregular menstrual cycles are two main features of ovarian dysfunction. Genetic defects can cause ovarian dysfunction, including chromosomal abnormalities and single gene alterations1–7. Mutations in STAG3, BMP15, FSHR, GDF9, NOBOX, MCM8,",0
"MCM9, NUP107, MSH4, CSB-PGBD3 and MSH5 can cause recessive primary amenorrhea8–17 or secondary amenorrhea18–20. Sequence variants in POLG, NR5A1, KHDRBS1, and NOBOX are reported to be associated with dominant primary21 or secondary amenorrhea22–24. In our clinical practice, some patients exhibit irregular menstrual cycles and poor outcomes of in vitro fertilization, but there is a lack of knowledge of the potential genetic contribution to this ovarian dysfunction. In this study, we examined a patient from a consanguin-",1
"eous family exhibiting irregular menstrual cycles and abnormal oocytes. Using whole-exome sequencing technology, we identified a novel homozygous POLG mutation in this patient. In contrast to previously reported heterozygous POLG mutations associated with premature ovarian failure (POF), this is the first recessive mode of inheritance of a POLG mutation in a patient with ovarian dysfunction. Materials and methods Patient",1
"A Chinese patient with ovarian dysfunction was recruited from The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, and was from a consanguineous family (Figure 1A). The patient did not show any of the following: karyotypic abnormalities, autoimmune disorders, history of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, or pelvic surgery. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Anhui Medical University. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient and her parents, and 5 ml of peripheral blood was collected from the patient.",1

"Exome sequence capture was performed using the SureSelect Human All Exon V5 Kit (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The captured libraries were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 Sequencer. Sequence reads were mapped against a human reference genome (hg19) using the BurrowsWheeler Aligner algorithm (http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/). The SNPs and Indels were detected by SAMtools (http://samtools.sourceforge.net/). Sanger sequencing was performed using gene-specific primers. Results Clinical characterization",0
"The proband (II-1, Figure 1A) was diagnosed with ovarian dysfunction and infertility at 32 years of age in 2017. Her height was 160 cm and weight was 60 kg. She experienced menarche at 15 years of age. Her menstrual cycle was irregular from 24 years of age, when she had a cycle length of approximately 4 months. Both ovaries were not clearly detected by transvaginal color Doppler ultrasound at the first-time consultancy. Circulating hormone levels of the proband were: 10.48 IU/l follicle stimulating hormone (FSH);",1
"2.77 IU/l luteinizing hormone (LH); 2.07 nmol/l testosterone; 54 pmol/l estradiol (E2); 10.03 ng/ml prolactin; and 0.05 ng/ml anti-Mu€llerian hormone (AMH). Magnetic resonance imaging showed the pituitary was normal. Examination revealed no progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), sensory ataxic neuropathy dysarthria, ophthalmoparesis, mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 4A, Leigh syndrome, or spinocerebellar ataxia with epilepsy. The proband’s mother (I-2) underwent menopause at the age of 54.",0
"To adjust the menstrual cycle and improve ovarian function, this patient had undergone 3 years of irregular hormone replacement therapy. Prior to ovarian stimulation in our hospital, 3 months of androgen supplement (dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) 25 mg three times a day) and regular hormone therapy (oral contraceptive: ethinylestradiol and cyproterone acetate tablets (Diane-35); for 21 days of each month) were used as an intervention method. Hormone levels were measured in duplicate: 7.46 IU/l FSH; 1.12 IU/l LH; and 33.43 pmol/l E2. No follicular development was detected in the subsequent three cycles using letrozole tablets (Furui; Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceutical Co, Lianyungang, China). The patient then received a constantly adjusted injection dose of menotropins (hMG; Lizhu Pharmaceutical Co, Zhuhai, China) but produced only one oocyte. Details and endpoints of the treatment are shown in Table 1.",0
"The pretreatment with DHEA and hormone replacement lowered the circulating FSH level, improved the ovarian sensitivity to FSH and increased the opportunity for oocyte development. The long stimulation lasted for about 1 month; one follicle about 20 x 17 mm could be detected on the left ovary. The only oocyte was retrieved from the left ovary by transvaginal ultrasound-guided puncture, approximately 36 h after induction of ovulation with 5000 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG; Lizhu Pharmaceutical Co.). After denuding the oocyte from surrounding granular cells using hyaluronidase, the abnormal presence of two polar bodies and granular cytoplasm (Figure 1B) indicated poor oocyte quality. Despite the aberrant morphology, the oocyte underwent intracytoplasmic sperm injection in vitro, but displayed complete fertilization failure.",1
Molecular genetic analysis,0
"Whole-exome sequencing with aligned sequence reads variant identification were performed, as previously described23. Pedigree analysis suggested an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance associated with this family (Figure 1A). We filtered out polymorphisms with allele frequencies >1% in The Short Genetic Variations database (dbSNP), 1000 Genomes (1000G), Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC), and Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) databases. A list of genes harboring coding/splicing homozygous variants were further filtered by the functional impact of the mutation (e.g. conservation and functional prediction by in silico prediction modules PolyPhen2, SIFT, and Mutationtaster).",0
"One homozygous POLG mutation (NM_002693:exon18: c.2890C > T: p.R964C) passed the filtering steps. This mutation was segregated within the family (Figure 2A). The POLG gene encodes a DNA polymerase-c involved in the replication of human mitochondrial DNA25. Mutations in POLG can cause POF or premature menopause, and all cases to date showed dominant inheritance22,26–28. Our study found the first POLG homozygous mutation in a patient with ovarian dysfunction. In silico analysis by five online prediction tools suggested that the p.R964C mutation was pathogenic CLIMACTERIC 469",1

"(Table 2). The mutation was also predicted a high risk for pathogenicity using the POLG Pathogenicity Prediction Server (http://polg.bmb.msu.edu/query.php). Amino acid R964 is located in the polymerase domain of POLG, and is highly conserved among different species ranging from human to zebrafish (Figure 2B), suggesting the functional importance of the R964 site. Discussion",0
"In this study, we report that a novel homozygous POLG mutation is associated with ovarian dysfunction in a patient with consanguineous pedigree. The POLG gene encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase-c involved in the replication of mitochondrial DNA25. Polg knock-out mice develop an mtDNA mutator phenotype associated with reduced",0
"lifespan, premature onset of aging-related phenotypes and reduced fertility29. Dominant or recessive mutations in human POLG can cause a spectrum of disorders associated with mitochondria dysfunction, including PEO, sensory ataxic neuropathy, familial Parkinsonism and progressive sclerosing poliodystrophy30–32. Most women with PEO exhibit early menopause26. The heterozygous p.Y955C, p.R943H, p.Y831C and p.S511N mutations of POLG can segregate with POF and PEO22,26,28,33,34. In addition, another heterozygous p.Y951N mutation in POLG was found in a patient with cataracts, early-onset distal muscle weakness and atrophy, ovarian dysgenesis (a severe form of POF) and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria27. Another study screened POLG mutations in 201 patients with spontaneous primary ovarian insufficiency and found one heterozygous p.R953C variant in a patient35. Therefore, POLG heterozygous mutations, including p.S511N, p.Y831C, p.R943H, p.Y951N, p.R953C, and p.Y955C, may be associated with syndromic or non-syndromic ovarian failure.",0
Previous studies have identified dominant POLG mutations,0
"in patients with ovarian failure. However, using pedigree and WES analysis, we have found the first homozygous POLG mutation in a patient with non-syndromic ovarian dysfunction, suggesting a recessive mode of mutation inheritance. The functional difference between the p.R964C mutation and previously reported heterozygous POLG mutations remains to be determined. However, as our reported case manifested as a non-syndromic ovarian dysfunction phenotype (a mild form compared with POF), we speculate that p.R964C produces a milder functional defect in POLG activity than the six abovementioned mutations. Further experiments are required to directly examine this proposal.",1
"Our study demonstrates, for the first time, that a novel biallelic POLG mutation (p.R964C) may cause ovarian dysfunction. This study expands our understanding of POLG mutations related to ovarian dysfunction, and the mode of inheritance of certain sequence variants. The information provided by this study may also assist in future genetic counseling and precision medicine approaches. Authors’ contributions",1

"9pt?>Isolated complex I deﬁciency is the most commonly identiﬁed biochemical defect in mitochondrial oxidative-phosphorylation disorders,[2] but it is probably under-diagnosed, since both lactate levels and muscle morphology may be normal[3,4] and the clinical features are extremely variable. The most common clinical phenotype in childhood is probably Leigh syndrome (LS, MIM 25600).[5,6] Other common phenotypes include Alpers syndrome.[2–4,6]",0
"The mitochondrial DNA depletion syndromes (MDS) are autosomal recessive disorders with genetic and clinical problems due to defect in the proteins involved in mtDNA replication resulting in decrease in the amount of mtDNA in the tissues and organs.[7,8] The nuclear-encoded mtDNA polymerase gamma (POLGI) gene provides instructions for making the active piece, called the alpha subunit, of a protein called polymerase gamma .Polg is the only DNA polymerase that is active in mitochondria and it is very important for replication of mtDNA.[9]POLGI is associated with mtDNA depletion syndromes.[10,11]",0
"Nuclear mutations are probably involved in 90% to 95% of children with complex I deﬁciency[12] but it was not until 1998 that the ﬁrst mutations were identiﬁed in the NDUFS4 and NDUFS8 genes by the group in Nijmegen.[13,14] An increasing number of pathogenic mutations in genes encoding different structural subunits of complex I have since then been identiﬁed. However, the genetic cause remains unclear in about 60% of patients with complex I deﬁciency.[12]",0
"The clinical phenotypes of POLG related disorders include the autosomal recessive and dominant adult onset progressive external ophthalmoplegia,[15,16] myoclonic epilepsy myopathy sensory ataxia syndrome,[17,18] ataxia neuropathy spectrum including mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndrome, and sensory ataxia neuropathy dysarthria ophthalmoplegia syndrome[19,20] and the hepatocerebral MDS (Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome).[21,22] POLG mutations were identiﬁed in individuals with clinical features of mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy disease (MNGIE).[23]",0
"In our report we describe a Saudi female neonate with a lethal mitochondrial depletion syndrome due to a novel POLG compound heterozygous mutation with severe hypotonia, very poor respiratory effort and gross dysmorphism. Her 3 siblings had died at another hospital with the same clinical scenario, hence genetic testing could not be performed. Case presentation",1
"A full term Saudi ±37 weeks gestational age female neonate delivered by caesarian section due to previous caesarian section with Apgar score 5 and 6 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively, was noticed immediately after birth to have severe hypotonia and very poor respiratory effort compromising her ventilation for which prompt intubation in delivery room was done and the baby was immediately shifted to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and connected to mechanical ventilation. She had dysmorphic features in the form of low set ears, micrognathia, bilateral clubfeet, and cleft palate.",1
The baby was born to ﬁrst-degree cousin parents to gravida 5 para 4 mother with 1 living 6 years old boy and 3 early neonatal deaths; 1 male and 2 females; all of them died with severe hypotonia and poor respiratory effort and all had the same dysmorphic features. They died in different hospitals with no speciﬁc ﬁnal diagnosis in all of them. Maternal polyhydramnious and weak fetal movement were consistent features in the pregnancies of our patient and all her siblings who died.,1
"Thorough examination of the patient in NICU revealed, birth weight of 2330 g (<10th percentile), length of 46 cm (25th percentile), and head circumference of 33 cm (25th percentile) with dysmorphic features typical to those found in her dead siblings.",1
"Neurologically, she had severe hypotonia compromising her ventilation and feeding, absent deep tendon reﬂexes in all limbs with intact cranial nerves. Extensive work up was carried out including; complete blood count, renal functions, liver functions, bone proﬁle, blood glucose, congenital infections screen, cerebrospinal ﬂuid analysis for cell count, glucose, protein, lactate, pyruvate and amino acids, tandem mass spectrometry for metabolic diseases, biotinidase level, very long chain fatty acids, abdominal ultrasonography, and karyotyping which all came out to be normal.",1
"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain showed elements of volume loss that includes prominent Sylvian ﬁssures and extraaxial spaces, marked alteration in the signal intensity affecting bilateral corpus striatum in both T2 and T1 (Fig. 1A and B). Remarkable lactate peak was also noted (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, MRI spectroscopy with Voxel on Basal Ganglia demonstrated decreased N-acetylaspartate (NAA) peak and increased choline peak (Fig. 1D).

"Parents were counseled about the clinical condition of their baby and the expected terminal event due to severe hypotonia and ventilator dependency.

Methods Exons 3 and 19 of the POLG gene (OMIM174763 chromosome 15q26.1) were ampliﬁed from genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced directly. The resulting sequence data were compared with the reference sequence NM_002693.2 Results",0
The baby carried the possibly pathogenic heterozygous variant c.680G>A (p.Arg227Gin) in exon 3 on paternal allele as well as the variant c.3098C>T (P.Ala1033Val) which is of unclear pathological signiﬁcance on the maternal allele of the POLG gene (Fig. 2). The possibly pathogenic POLG variant c.680G>A (p. Arg227Gin) in exon 3 was carried by the father in heterozygous state while the c.3098C>T (p.Ala1033Val) in exon 19 of the POLG gene was not detected (Fig. 3).,1
The reverse was true for the mother as she carried the c.3098C>T (p.Ala1033Val) variant in exon 19 of the POLG gene in heterozygous state while the c.680G>A (p.Arg227Gin) variant in exon 3 was not detected (Fig. 4). Genetic counseling of the parents was carried out to avoid recurrence of the condition in their offspring. The baby died at the age of 5 months after a prolonged stay in NICU on mechanical ventilation and total parenteral nutrition with failure of all attempts of weaning from mechanical ventilation and all trials of feeding.

"England study on adults with symptomatic mitochondrial disease of 2.9 per 100,000 compared with 20 per 100,000 for the pathogenic mtDNA mutations.[27] A Spanish study found an estimated prevalence of 5.7 per 100,000 for mitochondrial diseases in a population over 14 years of age.[28] Emmanuele et al[29] studied neonatal cord blood samples for 10 common mtDNA point mutations and a prevalence of 1 in 200 was detected. On the other hand, an Australian study Figure 2. Chromatogram of the patient.",0
"estimated the minimal birth prevalence of primary mitochondrial disorders to be 6.2 per 100,000 births.[30] To date, there are >230 reported mutations in the human POLG gene alone.[31] The number of individuals harboring a recessive pathogenic mutation in POLG has been estimated to approach 2% of the population.[26]",0
"There is one recently diagnosed infant with MNGIE syndrome who had severe hypotonia and generalized muscle weakness requiring ventilator assistance and severe abdominal distention with hypoactive bowel and congenital anomalies in the form of low set ears and bilateral clubfeet, with compound heterozygous missense mutation in c.679c>t predicting p.R227W and c.2542G>A predicting p.G848s. Sequencing of parental samples conﬁrmed recessive inheritance.[23]",0
Our patient is similar to this report in having severe hypotonia and poor respiratory effort with low set ears and bilateral clubfeet with a novel compound heterozygous mutation; c.680G>A (p. Arg227Gin) and c.3098C>T (P.Ala1033Val); in POLG gene. Segregation analysis revealed that the baby inherited the POLG variant c.680G>A (p. Arg227Gin) from the father while the POLG variant c.3098C>T (P.Ala10033Val) was inherited maternally. Figure 3. Chromatogram of the father.,1
"To the best of our knowledge the POLG variant c.680G>A (p. Arg227Gin) has not been described in literature or databases so far and there is no information regarding its allele frequency in the general population (ExAC database). Six out of 10 bioinformatic analysis tools used, predicted a signiﬁcant effect on protein function by the variant p.Arg227G conﬁrming its pathogenic effect. The mutation described by Giordano et al[32] is affecting the same protein position pArg227Trp in compound heterozygosity in his male patient with MNGIE syndrome.",0
The POLG variant c.3098C>T (P.Ala1033Val) has been annotated as a rare polymorphism (rs551708243) and its allele frequency in the general population is 0.02% (ExAC databases) which would be compatible with a potential pathogenicity. To the best of our knowledge the variant has not been described in the literature so far. A signiﬁcant effect on protein function was predicted by 2 out of 10 bioinformatic analysis tools used.,0
"Three siblings of our patient died with same clinical scenario. All of them had severe ﬂoppiness, respiratory failure, and were ventilator dependent which started immediately after birth. They all died in the neonatal period. These similarities in clinical ﬁndings emphasize the hypothesis that all of them carried the same disease and hypothetically the same mutation causing defective respiratory chain energy production like their currently reported sibling especially after genetic conﬁrmation of carrier status of their parents.",0
"Lack of genetic testing of the other 3 siblings who were delivered and died in another hospital might remain a limitation of our report. Figure 4. Chromatogram of the mother.

"Mutations in Polymerase c (POLG), one of the causative genetic abnormalities of mitochondrial disease, are generally present in patients with familial progressive external ophthalmoplegia. Some patients with this gene abnormality show a phenotype that consists of severe gastrointestinal manifestations including recurrent vomiting and intestinal pseudo-obstruction, which is similar to mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) due to mutations in the gene encoding thymidine phosphorylase (TP) [1]. MNGIE usually shows demyelinating peripheral neuropathy, leukoencephalopathy, ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, and cachexia. However, all cases with POLG mutations that mimic the MNGIE phenotype so far lack leukoencephalopathy on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or demyelinating polyneuropathy [2–4]. We report two newly detected characteristics in our patient that have not been reported in patients with POLG mutations with the MNGIE-like phenotype: leukoencephalopathy and demyelinating polyneuropathy.",0

His past medical history included recurrent bowel obstruction without any mechanical causes. His height was 171 cm, and his body weight was 46 kg. The patient exhibited a lower intelligence level (full IQ = 65). His cranial nerves showed bilateral ptosis, he had mild saccadic eye movement, and his speech was slurred.

"Routine blood tests did not reveal any abnormalities including blood cell count, serum protein, renal or liver function, coagulopathy. In addition, tests for anti-SS-A/SS-B, and anti-ganglioside antibodies were negative. A cerebrospinal fluid study showed elevated protein (204 mg/dl) and no pleocytosis. Lactate and pyruvic acid were increased in the cerebrospinal fluid, although levels of these were normal in the serum.",1
Brain MRI revealed diffuse leukoencephalopathy (Fig. 1A) and cerebellar atrophy. Nerve conduction studies showed reduced conduction velocities and markedly prolonged distal motor latencies with a decreased amplitude of compound muscle action potentials in the bilateral tibial nerves. The F wave minimum latency of these nerves was prolonged (Table 1). Temporal dispersion was detected in the bilateral tibial nerves (Fig. 1B). Sural nerves were not evoked bilaterally. The electrophysiological diagnosis was demyelinating sensorimotor polyneuropathy.,1

Vestibular schwannomas (VS) are the most common tumors involving the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) and the internal auditory canal (IAC). These tumors are usually slow-growing and commonly present with cranial nerve dysfunction such as hearing loss. Repeated intratumoral hemorrhage (ITH) is extremely rare with only four cases previously reported.,0

"WES was performed on genomic DNA samples taken from the two index patients. The SureSelect Human All Exon Kit (Agilent) was applied for in-solution enrichment, and the HiSeq 2500 instrument (Illumina) was used to produce 120 base pair paired-end sequence reads. The Burrows-Wheeler aligner and Freebayes were utilized for sequence alignment and variant calling. Exome data was uploaded into the GENESIS software for subsequent analysis (Gonzalez, et al., 2015). Amplifying and Sanger Sequencing of POLG exons 4 and 13",0
The POLG sequences for exons 4 and 13 from transcript NM_002693 were used to design amplification primers using Primer3 software. The primer design achieved amplification of,0
"~500 base pair regions of POLG, which included the mutations of interest (c.2243C>G/ p.Trp748Ser; c.2209G>C/ p.Gly737Arg; c.926G>A/p.Arg309His) flanked on both sides by approximately 250 base pairs. POLG exon 13 was amplified from the genomic DNA of the proband and her parents (family 1). POLG exons 4 and 13 were amplified from the genomic DNA of the proband and her parents (family 2). Amplification was achieved through PCR with Platinum Taq Polymerase (Thermo Fisher) on a thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems). PCR products were purified using the Qiagen PCR purification kit and submitted to Eurofins Genomics (Louisville, KY) for Sanger sequencing with their corresponding sequencing primers. The trace sequences were then analyzed using Sequencher software (Gene Codes). The primer sequences for PCR and Sanger sequencing can be found in Supplemental Figure 1.",0
Paternity Testing Paternity was established by comparative analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) between the proband and her parents (family 1) using fluorescently tagged microsatellite markers as probes. Microsatellites were amplified from the proband’s and the parent’s genomic DNA by PCR using Platinum Taq Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific). PCR reactions were carried out in a thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems).,0
Fragment analysis was performed in the 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) whereupon the raw data was analyzed using GeneMapper software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The microsatellite markers are found in Supplemental Figure 1. Copy-Number Variant Analysis,0
"The patient in family 1 had separate genomic testing performed through GeneDx. WholeGenome Oligonucleotide Array CGH+SNP Microarray analysis was performed. This microarray is based on human genome build GRCh37/hg19 and it contains approximately 118,000 probes that provide copy-number data and 66,000 probes that generate genotype data through the analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).

Blood samples were collected from participants after obtaining informed consent, DNA was extracted at the University of Miami, where WES was performed on the proband of each family. Standard software packages produced annotated next-generation sequencing results, which were then further analyzed within the GENESIS software platform. All results were confirmed in a CLIA-approved commercial laboratory",0
"The proband of family 1 (Figure 1a) was a 54-year-old woman of German ancestry. She reported a progressive balance disturbance since age 49 on the background of having had trouble walking heel-to-toe and hopping for many years. Her neurologic exam showed reduced vibration sensation (Rydell-Seiffer tuning fork 0–1 at the toes, 3–4 at the ankles and knees) and pinprick sensation (reduced to the mid-calves). Deep tendon reflexes, as well as strength, bulk and tone were normal. Smooth pursuit and saccadic eye movements and rapid alternating movements were normal. A MRI of the brain at age 52 was normal. At age 57, neuro-ophthalmic evaluation revealed a mild supranuclear vertical gaze paresis and a mild right internuclear ophthalmoparesis (slowed right adducting saccades with dissociated abducting nystagmus) localizing to the rostral midbrain (Liu, et al.). There was no gazeevoked nystagmus, saccadic dysmetria, or abnormal lack of suppression of the vestibuloocular reflex, and her optic nerves were normal in appearance. Nerve conductions of the left arm (Table 1) revealed mildly reduced sensory amplitudes and normal to reduced motor responses in the feet; electromyography of the left leg showed moderate, chronic denervation in distal muscles. When last seen at age 58, her balance had worsened. At age 79 and 85, her mother and father were evaluated, respectively. Both parents had had surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis. The mother had normal strength in the arms and legs; electrophysiology of the left arm showed no evidence of a neuropathy. The father had no movement in ankle dorsior plantar-flexion; strength in the arms was normal, and EMG of his left arm showed only mild, chronic denervation in his intrinsic hand muscles. For this reason, neuropathy alone is unlikely to be cause of the severe denervation in the legs. The nerve conduction of the father’s arms also showed evidence of a sensory neuropathy (antidromic left and right radial amplitudes were 10.5 and 9.3 µV; >15 µV is normal).",1
"WES of the proband in family 1 identified a homozygous variant (c.2243G>C/p.Trp748Ser) in exon 13 of POLG, previously described as pathogenic (Hakonen, et al., 2005). Sanger sequencing and segregation analysis revealed that the mother, but not the father, carried the allele in heterozygous state (Fig. 1A). After confirming the paternity of the father with RFLP Phillips et al. Page 4",1
"analysis using microsatellite markers as probes (Fig. 1B), further analysis of the proband’s whole-exome data with the GENESIS software and revealed a ~60Mb region of homozygosity on chromosome 15 (15q15.1–15q26.3) that included the POLG gene. To confirm that this was the only long region of homozygosity, we performed global isodisomy mapping utilizing the H3M2 algorithm (Magi, et al., 2014). Filtering for regions greater than 10 Mb (Bis, et al., 2017) revealed an extended region of homozygosity (chr15:43804173– 102359499), covering 72% of chromosome 15 (Fig. 1C). The isolation of the homozygous region to a single chromosome supports the occurrence of a uniparental isodisomic event rather than homozygosity due to consanguinity. Microarray analysis ruled out deletions on chromosome 15 in the proband and confirmed the presence of the ~60 Mb region of homozygosity. Deletion/duplication analysis for the POLG gene confirmed the copy-number neutral state of the POLG gene.",0
"The proband of family 2 (Figure 1) was evaluated at age 6 years for slowed psychomotor development, including delayed ambulation (age 3) and delayed speech, and subsequently developed progressive balance difficulties and motor issues. She had Achilles tendon lengthening, plantar flexor release, and transfer of the tibialis posterior tendon at age 9, followed by a Jones procedure at age 15, and has required a walker to ambulate ever since. She had achalasia with vomiting beginning at age 15, and two dilations within one month to mitigate symptoms. When first examined at age 16 (by SSS), she had severe weakness in ankle dorsiflexion, ankle plantar flexion, and intrinsic hand muscles, and moderate weakness of proximal leg muscles (hamstring 4/5 and quadriceps 4+/5). Vibration was absent at the toes and ankles and 2 at the knees. Pinprick was reduced to the knees. Neurophysiology of the right arm (Table 1) showed absent sensory responses and a reduced ulnar motor amplitude, and EMG showed severe, chronic denervation in first dorsal interosseous and extensor indices proprius. At age 19, she had started experiencing bolts of pain in her left leg, about once a day. She had no ankle dorsiflexon or plantar flexion and was areflexic in her arms and legs, and later that year, weakness had progressed to 2/5 in the right and 4-/5 left quadriceps and 4-/5 in the hamstrings. An MRI of the brain at age 19 was normal. At age 20, she was falling 1–2 times a day. Strength was unchanged, and pinprick was reduced to above the kneecap; vibration was absent at toes, ankles, and knees.",1
"WES of the proband in family 2 showed compound heterozygous mutations in POLG exon 4 (c.926G>A/p.Arg309His) and exon 13 (c.2209G>C/p.Gly737Arg). Sanger sequencing and subsequent segregation analysis showed that she had inherited one mutant allele from each of her parents (Figure 1). The patient also had a nonsynonymous mutation (p.Gly931Ser) in AARS, a gene that also causes CMT, but this mutation is too common (7/1,000 individuals in gnomAD) to be the cause of the proband’s disease. It is possible, however, that the AARS variant, or another, unidentified mutation, contributed to the proband’s neuropathy, as the father had electrophysiology evidence of an axonal neuropathy. It is possible that a heterozygous, p.Arg309His POLG mutation could cause a mild, late-onset, sensory neuropathy, but that has not been reported.",1
Phillips et al. Page 5 Discussion,0
"These two cases add to the literature on POLG mutations presenting as CMT (Harrower, et al., 2008; Hoyer, et al., 2014). In family 1, uniparental disomy (UPD) of the well documented p.Trp748Ser mutation caused a sensory neuropathy and subtle eye movement abnormalities. In family 2, compound heterozygous POLG mutations (p.Arg309His and p.Gly737Arg) caused a phenotype that is similar to that described in some cases in which the p.Arg309His or the p.Gly737Arg mutations are found in trans with other pathogenic POLG mutations (Da Pozzo et al. 2017, Harrower, et al. 2008). Thus, POLG should be considered for inclusion in genetic testing panels for CMT in order to effectively utilize NGS panels for CMT patients.",0
"POLG encodes the only DNA polymerase for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and mutations are associated with severe mtDNA depletion and accumulation of mutations in mtDNA over time as well as a bewildering spectrum of clinical syndromes (Rahman and Copeland, 2019). These include Alper-Huttenlocher spectrum (OMIM 203700; encephalopathy, intractable epilepsy, and hepatic failure), mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 4B (MNGIE; OMIM 613662; gastrointestinal dysmotility and pseudo-obstruction, cachexia), progressive external ophthalmoparesis (PEO) which can be further divided into autosomal dominant PEO (OMIM 157640; generalized myopathy and a combination of axonal neuropathy, ataxia, and sensoneural hearing loss), autosomal recessive PEO (OMIM 258450; weakness of extraocular muscles and exercise intolerance), and mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndromes (OMIM 607459), which include sensory ataxic neuropathy with dysarthria and progressive external ophthalmoparesis (SANDO) and spinocerebellar ataxia with epilepsy and parkinsonism (SCAE). Mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndrome (MIRAS; not in OMIM) can also refer to a more narrowly defined syndrome caused by Ala467Thr and Trp748Ser mutations (Mignarri, et al., 2015). SANDO is more commonly categorized within the Ataxia Neuropathy Spectrum (ANS; not in OMIM) and SCAE within Myoclonic Epilepsy Myopathy Sensory Ataxia (MEMSA) (Rahman and Copeland, 2019). There is a loose correlation between the degree of mitochondrial DNA depletion and the severity of the neurological manifestations.",0
"We report here the first case of UPD as the cause of a homozygous POLG mutation. UPD has been described in individual patients in a handful of inherited neuropathies - recessive NDRG1 (Safka Brozkova, et al., 2017), ARSA (Gonorazky, et al., 2017), MPZ (Benko, et al., 2008), GAN (Miyatake, et al., 2015), and SACS (Anesi, et al., 2011) mutations. UPD refers to the genetic phenomenon whereby an individual inherits both copies of a chromosomal fragment from one parent, instead of one chromosome from each parent. UPD arises through mitotic and/or meiotic error, as well as through trisomic rescue. Larger regions of homozygosity, such as the 60 Mb region in our case, are the hallmark of UPD, in contrast to smaller regions of homozygosity that are subject to copy number variation. In the absence of parental genotype information in typical clinical testing scenarios, any long stretches of homozygosity should be followed up with additional tests as UPD has potentially consequences for genetic counseling of patients. UPD is a rare cause of recessive disease (King, et al., 2014). For example, out of 96 families with unresolved causes of motoneuron disease or ataxia, one person (with spastic paraplegia) was found to have a",0
"Phillips et al. Page 6 homozygous mutation in FA2H resulting from UPD (Bis, et al., 2017). However, a recent screening of 214,915 trios revealed a UPD prevalence of 1 in 2000 births in the general population; this is twice the current clinical estimate (Nakka, et al., 2019).",0
"The p.Trp748Ser POLG variant that was affected by UPD in family 1 is common in European populations, especially Finnish (Hakonen, et al., 2005), and several homozygous patients have been described (Tzoulis, et al., 2006). They are phenotypically variable, although they usually develop ataxia, with a highly variable age of onset, from age 2 and into the 60s. Juvenile-onset cases can present with Alper-Huttenlocher spectrum, with liver failure provoked by valproic acid (Uusimaa, et al., 2008), but a SCAE/MEMSA presentation of migraine-like headache or seizures, and subsequent ataxia, with other features such as myoclonus, PEO, and dysarthria are more typical (Hakonen, et al., 2005; Tang, et al., 2011; Tzoulis, et al., 2006; Van Goethem and al., 2004). Adult-onset patients present with a SANDO/ANS phenotype. Initial clinical symptoms include balance disturbances, neuropathy, and/or ataxia, often accompanied by eye movement abnormalities (including PEO), dysarthria, parkinsonism, exercise intolerance, and cognitive decline (Hakonen, et al., 2005; Paucar, et al., 2016; Remes, et al., 2008). Hearing loss is common across all ages.",0
"The proband in family 2 is the first person to be described with the combination of p.Arg309His and p.Gly737Arg mutations. Both mutations cause neurological disease in trans with other POLG mutations. In trans with a p.Arg627Gln mutation, the p.Arg309His mutation caused Alper-Huttenlocher spectrum (Horvath, et al., 2006); in trans with p.Gly1051Arg mutation, it caused neuropathy, achalasia, developmental delay, and epilepsy (Da Pozzo, et al., 2017); except for the seizures, these are similar features of our patient. In trans with a p.Ala767Asp mutation, the p.Gly737Arg mutation caused Alper-Huttenlocher spectrum (Horvath, et al., 2006); in trans with a p.Arg853Trp mutation, it caused axonal sensorimotor neuropathy, mild distal myopathy, and parkinsonism (Davidzon, et al., 2005); in trans with a p.Trp748Ser mutation, it caused a late onset axonal sensory neuropathy, bilateral hearing loss, complete external ophthalmoplegia, and ptosis (Tzoulis, et al., 2009), in trans with p.Ala467Thr, it caused SANDO (Wong, et al., 2008); in trans with p.Arg232His, it caused a phenotype similar to our patient - abnormal gait and pes cavus at age 10, distal myopathy and reduced dexterity and sensory disturbances, progressing to cerebellar dysarthria and dysphagia, absent tendon reflexes, diminished sensation to all limbs, and inability to walk by the age 35 (Harrower, et al., 2008).",0

POLG exon 13 was amplified from the genomic DNA of the proband and her parents (family 1). POLG exons 4 and 13 were amplified from the genomic DNA of the proband and her parents (family 2). Amplification was achieved through PCR with Platinum Taq Polymerase (Thermo Fisher) on a thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems). PCR products were purified using the Qiagen PCR purification kit and submitted to Eurofins Genomics (Louisville, KY) for Sanger sequencing with their corresponding sequencing primers. The trace sequences were then analyzed using Sequencher software (Gene Codes). The primer sequences for PCR and Sanger sequencing can be found in Supplemental Figure 1.",0
Paternity Testing Paternity was established by comparative analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) between the proband and her parents (family 1) using fluorescently tagged microsatellite markers as probes. Microsatellites were amplified from the proband’s and the parent’s genomic DNA by PCR using Platinum Taq Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific). PCR reactions were carried out in a thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems).,0

They had a CMT Neuropathy Score version 2, which includes electrophysiology of the upper extremities (Murphy, et al., 2011). Blood samples were collected from participants after obtaining informed consent, DNA was extracted at the University of Miami, where WES was performed on the proband of each family. Standard software packages produced annotated next-generation sequencing results, which were then further analyzed within the GENESIS software platform. All results were confirmed in a CLIA-approved commercial laboratory",0
"The proband of family 1 (Figure 1a) was a 54-year-old woman of German ancestry. She reported a progressive balance disturbance since age 49 on the background of having had trouble walking heel-to-toe and hopping for many years. Her neurologic exam showed reduced vibration sensation (Rydell-Seiffer tuning fork 0–1 at the toes, 3–4 at the ankles and knees) and pinprick sensation (reduced to the mid-calves). Deep tendon reflexes, as well as strength, bulk and tone were normal. Smooth pursuit and saccadic eye movements and rapid alternating movements were normal. A MRI of the brain at age 52 was normal. At age 57, neuro-ophthalmic evaluation revealed a mild supranuclear vertical gaze paresis and a mild right internuclear ophthalmoparesis (slowed right adducting saccades with dissociated abducting nystagmus) localizing to the rostral midbrain (Liu, et al.). There was no gazeevoked nystagmus, saccadic dysmetria, or abnormal lack of suppression of the vestibuloocular reflex, and her optic nerves were normal in appearance. Nerve conductions of the left arm (Table 1) revealed mildly reduced sensory amplitudes and normal to reduced motor responses in the feet; electromyography of the left leg showed moderate, chronic denervation in distal muscles. When last seen at age 58, her balance had worsened. At age 79 and 85, her mother and father were evaluated, respectively. Both parents had had surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis. The mother had normal strength in the arms and legs; electrophysiology of the left arm showed no evidence of a neuropathy. The father had no movement in ankle dorsior plantar-flexion; strength in the arms was normal, and EMG of his left arm showed only mild, chronic denervation in his intrinsic hand muscles. For this reason, neuropathy alone is unlikely to be cause of the severe denervation in the legs. The nerve conduction of the father’s arms also showed evidence of a sensory neuropathy (antidromic left and right radial amplitudes were 10.5 and 9.3 µV; >15 µV is normal).",1
"WES of the proband in family 1 identified a homozygous variant (c.2243G>C/p.Trp748Ser) in exon 13 of POLG, previously described as pathogenic (Hakonen, et al., 2005). Sanger sequencing and segregation analysis revealed that the mother, but not the father, carried the allele in heterozygous state (Fig. 1A). After confirming the paternity of the father with RFLP Phillips et al. Page 4",1
"analysis using microsatellite markers as probes (Fig. 1B), further analysis of the proband’s whole-exome data with the GENESIS software and revealed a ~60Mb region of homozygosity on chromosome 15 (15q15.1–15q26.3) that included the POLG gene. To confirm that this was the only long region of homozygosity, we performed global isodisomy mapping utilizing the H3M2 algorithm (Magi, et al., 2014). Filtering for regions greater than 10 Mb (Bis, et al., 2017) revealed an extended region of homozygosity (chr15:43804173– 102359499), covering 72% of chromosome 15 (Fig. 1C). The isolation of the homozygous region to a single chromosome supports the occurrence of a uniparental isodisomic event rather than homozygosity due to consanguinity. Microarray analysis ruled out deletions on chromosome 15 in the proband and confirmed the presence of the ~60 Mb region of homozygosity. Deletion/duplication analysis for the POLG gene confirmed the copy-number neutral state of the POLG gene.",0
"The proband of family 2 (Figure 1) was evaluated at age 6 years for slowed psychomotor development, including delayed ambulation (age 3) and delayed speech, and subsequently developed progressive balance difficulties and motor issues. She had Achilles tendon lengthening, plantar flexor release, and transfer of the tibialis posterior tendon at age 9, followed by a Jones procedure at age 15, and has required a walker to ambulate ever since. She had achalasia with vomiting beginning at age 15, and two dilations within one month to mitigate symptoms. When first examined at age 16 (by SSS), she had severe weakness in ankle dorsiflexion, ankle plantar flexion, and intrinsic hand muscles, and moderate weakness of proximal leg muscles (hamstring 4/5 and quadriceps 4+/5). Vibration was absent at the toes and ankles and 2 at the knees. Pinprick was reduced to the knees. Neurophysiology of the right arm (Table 1) showed absent sensory responses and a reduced ulnar motor amplitude, and EMG showed severe, chronic denervation in first dorsal interosseous and extensor indices proprius. At age 19, she had started experiencing bolts of pain in her left leg, about once a day. She had no ankle dorsiflexon or plantar flexion and was areflexic in her arms and legs, and later that year, weakness had progressed to 2/5 in the right and 4-/5 left quadriceps and 4-/5 in the hamstrings. An MRI of the brain at age 19 was normal. At age 20, she was falling 1–2 times a day. Strength was unchanged, and pinprick was reduced to above the kneecap; vibration was absent at toes, ankles, and knees.",1
"WES of the proband in family 2 showed compound heterozygous mutations in POLG exon 4 (c.926G>A/p.Arg309His) and exon 13 (c.2209G>C/p.Gly737Arg). Sanger sequencing and subsequent segregation analysis showed that she had inherited one mutant allele from each of her parents (Figure 1). The patient also had a nonsynonymous mutation (p.Gly931Ser) in AARS, a gene that also causes CMT, but this mutation is too common (7/1,000 individuals in gnomAD) to be the cause of the proband’s disease. It is possible, however, that the AARS variant, or another, unidentified mutation, contributed to the proband’s neuropathy, as the father had electrophysiology evidence of an axonal neuropathy. It is possible that a heterozygous, p.Arg309His POLG mutation could cause a mild, late-onset, sensory neuropathy, but that has not been reported.",1
Phillips et al. Page 5 Discussion,0
"These two cases add to the literature on POLG mutations presenting as CMT (Harrower, et al., 2008; Hoyer, et al., 2014). In family 1, uniparental disomy (UPD) of the well documented p.Trp748Ser mutation caused a sensory neuropathy and subtle eye movement abnormalities. In family 2, compound heterozygous POLG mutations (p.Arg309His and p.Gly737Arg) caused a phenotype that is similar to that described in some cases in which the p.Arg309His or the p.Gly737Arg mutations are found in trans with other pathogenic POLG mutations (Da Pozzo et al. 2017, Harrower, et al. 2008). Thus, POLG should be considered for inclusion in genetic testing panels for CMT in order to effectively utilize NGS panels for CMT patients.",0
"POLG encodes the only DNA polymerase for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and mutations are associated with severe mtDNA depletion and accumulation of mutations in mtDNA over time as well as a bewildering spectrum of clinical syndromes (Rahman and Copeland, 2019). These include Alper-Huttenlocher spectrum (OMIM 203700; encephalopathy, intractable epilepsy, and hepatic failure), mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 4B (MNGIE; OMIM 613662; gastrointestinal dysmotility and pseudo-obstruction, cachexia), progressive external ophthalmoparesis (PEO) which can be further divided into autosomal dominant PEO (OMIM 157640; generalized myopathy and a combination of axonal neuropathy, ataxia, and sensoneural hearing loss), autosomal recessive PEO (OMIM 258450; weakness of extraocular muscles and exercise intolerance), and mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndromes (OMIM 607459), which include sensory ataxic neuropathy with dysarthria and progressive external ophthalmoparesis (SANDO) and spinocerebellar ataxia with epilepsy and parkinsonism (SCAE). Mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndrome (MIRAS; not in OMIM) can also refer to a more narrowly defined syndrome caused by Ala467Thr and Trp748Ser mutations (Mignarri, et al., 2015). SANDO is more commonly categorized within the Ataxia Neuropathy Spectrum (ANS; not in OMIM) and SCAE within Myoclonic Epilepsy Myopathy Sensory Ataxia (MEMSA) (Rahman and Copeland, 2019). There is a loose correlation between the degree of mitochondrial DNA depletion and the severity of the neurological manifestations.",0
"We report here the first case of UPD as the cause of a homozygous POLG mutation. UPD has been described in individual patients in a handful of inherited neuropathies - recessive NDRG1 (Safka Brozkova, et al., 2017), ARSA (Gonorazky, et al., 2017), MPZ (Benko, et al., 2008), GAN (Miyatake, et al., 2015), and SACS (Anesi, et al., 2011) mutations. UPD refers to the genetic phenomenon whereby an individual inherits both copies of a chromosomal fragment from one parent, instead of one chromosome from each parent. UPD arises through mitotic and/or meiotic error, as well as through trisomic rescue. Larger regions of homozygosity, such as the 60 Mb region in our case, are the hallmark of UPD, in contrast to smaller regions of homozygosity that are subject to copy number variation. In the absence of parental genotype information in typical clinical testing scenarios, any long stretches of homozygosity should be followed up with additional tests as UPD has potentially consequences for genetic counseling of patients. UPD is a rare cause of recessive disease (King, et al., 2014). For example, out of 96 families with unresolved causes of motoneuron disease or ataxia, one person (with spastic paraplegia) was found to have a",0
"Phillips et al. Page 6 homozygous mutation in FA2H resulting from UPD (Bis, et al., 2017). However, a recent screening of 214,915 trios revealed a UPD prevalence of 1 in 2000 births in the general population; this is twice the current clinical estimate (Nakka, et al., 2019).",0
"The p.Trp748Ser POLG variant that was affected by UPD in family 1 is common in European populations, especially Finnish (Hakonen, et al., 2005), and several homozygous patients have been described (Tzoulis, et al., 2006). They are phenotypically variable, although they usually develop ataxia, with a highly variable age of onset, from age 2 and into the 60s. Juvenile-onset cases can present with Alper-Huttenlocher spectrum, with liver failure provoked by valproic acid (Uusimaa, et al., 2008), but a SCAE/MEMSA presentation of migraine-like headache or seizures, and subsequent ataxia, with other features such as myoclonus, PEO, and dysarthria are more typical (Hakonen, et al., 2005; Tang, et al., 2011; Tzoulis, et al., 2006; Van Goethem and al., 2004). Adult-onset patients present with a SANDO/ANS phenotype. Initial clinical symptoms include balance disturbances, neuropathy, and/or ataxia, often accompanied by eye movement abnormalities (including PEO), dysarthria, parkinsonism, exercise intolerance, and cognitive decline (Hakonen, et al., 2005; Paucar, et al., 2016; Remes, et al., 2008). Hearing loss is common across all ages.",0
"The proband in family 2 is the first person to be described with the combination of p.Arg309His and p.Gly737Arg mutations. Both mutations cause neurological disease in trans with other POLG mutations. In trans with a p.Arg627Gln mutation, the p.Arg309His mutation caused Alper-Huttenlocher spectrum (Horvath, et al., 2006); in trans with p.Gly1051Arg mutation, it caused neuropathy, achalasia, developmental delay, and epilepsy (Da Pozzo, et al., 2017); except for the seizures, these are similar features of our patient. In trans with a p.Ala767Asp mutation, the p.Gly737Arg mutation caused Alper-Huttenlocher spectrum (Horvath, et al., 2006); in trans with a p.Arg853Trp mutation, it caused axonal sensorimotor neuropathy, mild distal myopathy, and parkinsonism (Davidzon, et al., 2005); in trans with a p.Trp748Ser mutation, it caused a late onset axonal sensory neuropathy, bilateral hearing loss, complete external ophthalmoplegia, and ptosis (Tzoulis, et al., 2009), in trans with p.Ala467Thr, it caused SANDO (Wong, et al., 2008); in trans with p.Arg232His, it caused a phenotype similar to our patient - abnormal gait and pes cavus at age 10, distal myopathy and reduced dexterity and sensory disturbances, progressing to cerebellar dysarthria and dysphagia, absent tendon reflexes, diminished sensation to all limbs, and inability to walk by the age 35 (Harrower, et al., 2008).",0

The patient underwent genetic testing (specific gene study by direct sequencing and bidirectional allele specific PCR) that confirmed the presence of pathogenic mutations on POLG gene: variant T251I/P587 L in cis configuration in allele 1 and variant R807C in allele 2 - compound heterozygosity of three known pathogenic mutations (figure 3).,1
diFFerenTial diagnoSiS,0
"Our patient was initially considered to have possible ocular myasthenia gravis, as well as a concomitant (severe) sensory diabetic polyneuropathy. Despite not having a clear clinical fatigability, given the age of our patient and his ocular findings, a diagnosis of ocular myasthenia gravis was our first diagnostic hypothesis. The peripheral neuropathy is a well-known complication of diabetes and therefore it was not unreasonable to think about this initial diagnosis since the patient had suffered from diabetes for several years. However, his neurophysiology evaluation was not in favour of a post-synaptic neuromuscular junction disorder, the autoantibodies for autoimmune myasthenia gravis",0
"were negative and treatment with pyridostigmine was ineffective prompting us to consider other diagnosis. We considered oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy as a possible diagnosis, given the slight dysphagia, eyelid ptosis, and proximal limb weakness as well as late life presentation. However, the prominence of sensory ataxia, ophthalmoplegia and tremor found in our patient as well as absent family history did not support this diagnosis.12",0
"Based on the patient's presentation, and given the multiple neurological systems involved, namely sensory nerves, muscle fibres, parkinsonism and external ophthalmoplegia, we considered the possibility of a mitochondrial disease. The mitochondrial disorders are an inherited group of diseases, maternally transmitted or autosomal recessive or due to sporadic mutations, compatible with the lack of family history in our patient. TreaTmenT",1
"Under the clinical suspicion of ocular myasthenia gravis, the patient started treatment with pyridostigmine without any relevant response. More recently, after the diagnosis of mitochondrial disease, our patient was treated with coenzyme Q10 but he did not tolerate this drug due to side-effects. Considering the worsened parkinsonism, the patient was started on levodopa, although with little clinical response. The patient and his primary care physician were informed about the risk of taking valproic acid, since it may precipitate fulminant liver disease.2 ouTCome and Follow-up",0
"Although there is no specific treatment for mitochondrial disease, our patient has a moderate, but stable, disability after 2 years of follow-up. Parkinsonism associated with mitochondrial disease usually does not have a good response to treatment with L-dopa and progressive worsening can lead to a marked disability. He maintains regular follow-up in our outpatient clinic for continued clinical monitoring and supportive care. diSCuSSion",0
"The wide phenotypical variation among patients with mitochondrial disorders makes the diagnosis difficult. Patients can present with sensory or cerebellar ataxia, ophthalmoparesis, ptosis, peripheral neuropathy, cognitive impairment, myopathy, seizures, encephalopathy, hepatopathy, psychiatric disorders, pyramidal or extra-pyramidal symptoms and headaches, either isolated or combined.1 2 POLG mutations are a major cause of mitochondrial diseases, accounting for up to 25% of them.13 Interestingly, despite the large number of pathogenic mutations reported in POLG1-associated mitochondrial disease, the common final pathway seems to be an accumulation of errors on mtDNA, with a subsequent abnormal oxidative phosphorylation leading to clinical symptoms.1 POLG1-related disorders are grouped within five major phenotypes: Alpers–Huttenlocher syndrome, childhood myocerebrohepatopathy spectrum disorders, myoclonic epilepsy myopathy sensory ataxia, ataxia neuropathy spectrum, autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia and autosomal recessive progressive external ophthalmoplegia with or without SANDO.2 Irrespective of the phenotype, levodopa responsive parkinsonism has been described as a rare and late-onset complication of POLG mutations, preceded several years by the onset of CPEO or SANDO manifestations.10 11 In fact, mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to reduced ATP production or oxidative stress, has emerged as one of the neurodegenerative pathogenic mechanism associated with Parkinson disease,10 and according to Luoma et al,11",0
"parkinsonism seems to significantly coseggregate with POLG mutations (p<0.0001). Muscle fibres of patients with CPEO due to POLG1 mutations seem to have more COX-negative fibres than RRF, which could contribute to misdiagnosis, especially in older patients, considering that age-related changes in human skeletal muscle mitochondria result in an accumulation of deletions of mtDNA and in the natural appearance of ragged-red fibres (RRF) and COX-negative fibres. Still, despite the natural ageing alterations, that prevail after 40–50 years old, the overall percentage of RRF and COX-negative fibres should remain at around 1% in individuals without mitochondrial disorders.14",0
"In the specific case of SANDO, Fadic et al in 1997,6 with the description of four patients, hypothesised, for the first time, that SANDO could represent a novel mitochondrial disease associated with multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions. Since then a small number of cases has been reported and as such, the real prevalence of this syndrome is unknown but it is believed as quite rare. More recently, Hanisch et al8 reported nine patients and two additional family members fulfilling the clinical criteria for SANDO. Within this group, six of the 11 patients had POLG mutations. The average age of onset in this group was 38.3 years (23–59 years old, although among patients with POLG mutations detected, the oldest patient was 49 years old). The majority of the patients sought medical advice because of gait ataxia and all patients with SANDO had mild dysarthria. None of the 11 patients had parkinsonism. The most frequent mutation on their cohort was the A467T mutation followed by the W748S mutation. According to the same paper, these results were consistent with previous studies on SANDO syndrome (number of patients=29) concerning age of onset, symptoms and detected POLG mutations.8 Other previous reported POLG1 mutations linked with the SANDO phenotype include P587L, T257I, R807C (our patient carries these three mutations), L304R, R627W, R3P, R1138C, E1143G, G737R, G848S, P648R, and",0
A627Q.3–9 Most mutations are found in compound heterozygotes containing multiple mutations in cis and in trans or in homozygosity.1 2,0
"In our particular case, there was already a high clinical suspicion for mitochondrial disease before muscle biopsy was performed. Milone et al4 reported five cases of adult onset autosomal recessive sensory ataxic neuropathy with ophthalmoparesis and concluded that given the inconsistency of muscle findings, the molecular analysis of POLG gene remains the most informative and definitive diagnostic test. They suggest that genetic testing for POLG mutations should be included among first line tests in patients with high suspicion for mitochondrial disorders. In line with that, according to Tchikviladzé et al,15 the presence of more than three different clinical signs (neuropathy, ptosis/ophthalmoplegia, axial/limb muscle weakness, cerebellar syndrome, movement disorder, psychiatric symptoms, hypoacousia, cognitive defect) and the absence of pyramidal involvement is sufficient to directly perform POLG sequencing.",0
"Mutations found in our patient were considered autosomal recessive in inheritance or sporadic since neither his parents nor siblings had symptoms. All mutations were reported before in other cases involving either SANDO syndrome or parkinsonism.5 7 10 To our knowledge, our patient is a compound heterozygote with a combination of mutations not previously described. The age of disease onset in our patient is highly unusual making this case a unique presentation. A combination of genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors may explain the delayed onset.1",0
"There is no specific treatment for mitochondrial diseases related to POLG1 mutations. They tend to be progressive and can lead to marked disability in some patients.

"We report a 15-year-old female with POLG-related mitochondrial disease who developed severe multifocal epilepsia partialis continua, unresponsive to standard anti seizure drug treatment and general anesthesia. Based on an earlier case report, we treated her focal seizures that affected her right upper limb with 20-min sessions of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) at an intensity of 2 mA on each of ﬁve consecutive days. The cathode was placed over the left primary motor cortex, the anode over the contralateral orbitofrontal cortex. Surface electromyography (EMG) were recorded 20 min before, 20 min during, and 20 min after four of ﬁve tDCS sessions to measure its effect on the muscle jerks. The electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded before and after tDCS to measure the frequency of spikes. Our results showed no statistically or clinically signiﬁcant reduction of seizures or epileptiform activity using EEG and EMG, with this treatment protocol. To our knowledge, this is only the second time that adjunct tDCS treatment of epileptic seizures has been tried in POLG-related mitochondrial disease. Taken together with the positive ﬁndings from the earlier case report, the present study highlights that more data are needed to determine if, and under which parameters, the treatment is effective.",0

"Mitochondrial diseases are a group of genetic disorders affecting about one in 5000 people [1]. The symptoms are diverse but since mitochondria produce energy for body tissues through production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), organs with high energy consumption, such as the brain, are often affected. For example, as many as 35% to 60% of people with mitochondrial disease develop seizures [1]. In POLG-related mitochondrial disease, a genetic mutation interferes with a catalytic subunit of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma, which replicates mitochondrial DNA [2], leading to depleted mitochondrial DNA [3]. Once the resulting neuronal energy failure reaches a critical point, neuronal death ensues, causes atrophy and potentially",0

"acts as the trigger for epilepsy that in turn increases neuronal loss [4]. A study found mitochondrial dysfunction in one third of patients with epilepsy that underwent metabolic testing [5], emphasizing that drugresistant seizures are a frequent problem in mitochondrial disease, and that new treatments need to be developed. In a previous case report, focal seizures in a patient with POLG-related mitochondrial disease ceased after two weeks of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) [6]. Since these seizures are often refractory to medical treatment and the technique is non-invasive, we tested tDCS using similar parameters as in Ng et al. [6] in a patient with POLG-related mitochondrial disease and drug-resistant multifocal epilepsy.",0

At the point where tDCS treatment was instituted, the patient had a multifocal seizures with multiple semiologies (Fig. 1A and B) including a multifocal, asynchronous myoclonus, that was dominant and most debilitating in the right hand. We thus targeted the left primary motor cortex with tDCS, as the myoclonus activity most likely arose from that area, with the goal to relieve pain and disability. Methods of tDCS and EEG",1
"The use of tDCS was discussed with the local ethical committee who considered it a form of supplementary experimental treatment whose purpose was to provide care for an individual, and for which the caring physician could take responsibility without obtaining the committees' approval. Verbal consent was obtained from the parents and treatment was reported in the patient's medical journal. tDCS was applied for 20 min at 2 mA on each of ﬁve consecutive days with a DC-Stimulator PLUS (neuroConn, Ilmenau, Germany) through 5 × 7 cm rubber electrodes with saline soaked sponges giving a current density of",0

"right hand, the cathode was placed over the contralateral left primary motor cortex at approximately C3 of the 10–20 EEG system (see Fig. 2A). The rationale was that cathodal stimulation has been shown to reduce cortical excitability in the brain area underneath the electrode and hence might reduce epileptic activity causing the myoclonus [8]. The anode was placed on the right orbitofrontal cortex (approximately Fp2).",0
"By placing the electrode on the contralateral side, the electric ﬁeld between anode and cathode crosses the midline and was hoped to affect the motor cortex most effectively. Since the anode is active and expected to increase cortical excitability, a better setup would have included an extra-large anode that would effectively reduce the current strength. However, as the tDCS treatment was issued at short notice, we did not have large electrodes available at the time. We chose the orbitofrontal region, because it is often used as a control site in tDCS experiments [9] and because it was not particularly affected by epilepsy. Indeed, we did not observe a worsening in the EEG in this region after the treatment. The tDCS setup was used in accordance with safety guidelines [10,11].",0
"Initial EEG recordings and seizure monitoring during status epilepticus were done with continuous 25 channel clinical EEG and scored visually by experienced neurophysiologists. With the cathode placed over the left primary motor cortex, we looked for improvement particularly in the right hand. Continuous EEG was measured from C3 and C4 (right motor cortex as control) for 20 min before and 20 min after tDCS, from a clinical EEG setup following the 10/20 system with 6 + 2 (F3, F4, P3, P4, O1, O2) electrodes and video monitoring of the patient. EMG data from the right hand and left trapezius was acquired continuously for 20 min before tDCS, during 20 min tDCS, and 20 min after tDCS. EEG data was not interpretable during tDCS due to ampliﬁer blocking. EMG and EEG data were recorded on four out of ﬁve days.",0
"Three separate raters, two neurophysiologists (TE, HKO) and the tDCS clinician (LM), counted the frequency of spikes (EEG) and muscle jerks (EMG) drawn from multiple random samples. Speciﬁcally, the data were binned into 12 ﬁve-minute segments. Then, each rater picked randomly ten, artifact-free one-second periods from each ﬁve-minute segment on all four days and determined the mean number of EEG spikes and EMG jerks per second (Hz) for all four measurements (C3, C4, right hand, left trapezius). Subsequently, means were calculated across raters (see Fig. 2B) and EEG data was subjected to paired sample t-tests and non-parametric Wilcoxon tests, comparing spikes before and after tDCS. The means for EMG data were subjected to an ANOVA with the repeated measures variable Time (before, during after tDCS) and a non-parametric Friedman test. Non-parametric Friedman and Wilcoxon tests were included because not all variables met the normal distribu-",0
"tion criterion necessary for t-tests and ANOVAs — due to the limited range of values for spikes/jerks per second. At the same time, nonparametric tests are sometimes not sensitive enough to pick up small effects. In the interest of comprehensiveness, we thus decided to report ﬁndings from both ANOVA/Friedman and paired sample t-tests/ Wilcoxon tests. We also compared the pre-tDCS data on day one (baseline) to the post-tDCS data on day ﬁve using tand Wilcoxon tests, assuming that the treatment effect should be strongest between these measurement points. Results",0
"Fig. 2C shows the average frequency of epileptic spikes and jerks in the right hand and left shoulder during treatment. According to ttests/Wilcoxon tests for EEG data and the ANOVAs/Friedman tests for EMG data, there were no signiﬁcant differences in the means across all raters in C3 or C4 spikes (all ts(15) ≤ 0.613, all ps ≥ 0.549; all χ2s(1) ≤ 0.091, all ps ≥ 0.763) as well as jerks in the right hand and left shoulder (all Fs(2,30) ≤ 1.74, all ps ≥ 0.192; all Zs ≥ 0.642, all ps ≥ 0.521).

"TDCS treatment was given in March 2018. The stimulation itself was well tolerated. The patient only reported short-term skin irritation from the net holding the electrodes in place. Four months after receiving tDCS, the patient was discharged from the hospital, still with upper limb jerking, but was readmitted in December 2018 and died due to a super-refractory status epilepticus. Discussion",0
"Neither spike nor jerk frequency changed over the course of ﬁve tDCS sessions (between before, during, and after tDCS) or when comparing baseline spike/jerk rates from day one to after treatment on day ﬁve. We therefore conclude that – in this case study – tDCS did not have a beneﬁcial treatment effect on treatment-resistant refractory epilepsia partialis continua in POLG-related mitochondrial disease. Hence, our results are inconsistent with those of Ng et al. [6], who found that seizures stopped completely in a similar case study.",0
"There are several differences between the two case studies that could explain the different outcomes: Ng et al. [6] placed the cathode over the right temporo-parietal–occipital junction (P4/T6), while in our study it was over the left primary motor cortex. Ng et al. provided tDCS treatment twice, once for three days and once for 14 days, while",0
"we provided tDCS treatment once for ﬁve days. However, the treatment in our case was stopped before the completion of 14 days because there was no sign of improvement and due to technical reasons/staff availability. Moreover, while the patients appeared to have similar seizure frequency their genotypes were different; the patient reported by Ng and colleagues was homozygous for the c.1399GNA whereas our patient was homozygous for the c.2243GNC genotype. Both patients were also on multiple, but different anticonvulsant regimens, raising the possibility that competing mechanisms modulated response to tDCS. Lastly, our case was severe, so by the time we started the intervention the seizures may have become refractory to both medication and tDCS treatment. We cannot rule out that cathodal stimulation elsewhere (e.g., over the right occipital region) might have yielded a better treatment response, perhaps, at an earlier stage of the disease. However, while the patient had a multifocal epilepsy with multiple semiologies, we speciﬁcally targeted the left motor cortex to reduce the myoclonic jerking of the right hand that the patient found very debilitating. Similarly, we cannot rule out that stimulating for more than ﬁve days would have worked better.",0
According to guidelines published by a European expert consortium,0
"in 2017, and several reviews, it is not yet possible to draw conclusions regarding the efﬁcacy of tDCS in any kind of epilepsy, even though there are some promising results [12–15]. Similarly, it remains unclear whether transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), another type of non-invasive brain stimulation, is an effective treatment of epilepsy [16–18], although there are some positive ﬁndings for epilepsia partialis continua [19]. Even less is known about how these non-invasive brain stimulation techniques will affect patients with mitochondrial diseases. However, given that refractory epilepsy appears to be common in these diseases [5], ﬁnding novel treatments is highly relevant. To our knowledge, this is only the second documented attempt to use tDCS in mito-",0
"chondrial disease. With one positive and one negative result, it is too early to say whether tDCS will ﬁnd a place in the treatment of mitochondrial epilepsy, but during the early stages of any new treatment, all ﬁndings, negative or positive, need to be published to obtain a clearer overall picture. This is particularly relevant in this case, where almost nothing is known about the efﬁcacy of tDCS for epilepsy in patients with mitochondrial diseases. Further, because the condition is so rare, it is difﬁcult to realize randomized controlled trials with decent sample",0
sizes and that could control for potential placebo effects. A ﬁnal reason for why we deem it important to report this negative ﬁnding is – despite its limited contribution to the literature – that there is growing awareness of reporting bias and replication issues in the scientiﬁc community and with it a growing recognition of the relevance of negative ﬁndings. We hope that our ﬁndings contribute to a growing body of literature and encourage other scientists to provide larger samples and proper clinical trials. Author contribution,0

"Mitochondriopathies are a heterogeneous group of genetic diseases of all ages, with a very diverse clinical presentation related to genetic heteroplasmy. The clinical symptoms display a large variability and generally, the more severe phenotypes have an early onset, even from the neonatal period, while milder ones are manifested later in the adulthood. Most publications have already demonstrated deletions or point mutations in mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), but in recent years, the field of investigation has expanded to syndromes caused by mutations in the nuclear DNA (nDNA), with a Mendelian inheritance. We present the case of a male patient with a mitochondriopathy with phenotype of chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), due to an autosomal dominant mutation in nDNA, in the DNA polymerase subunit gamma (POLG) gene, the pathogenic variant c.2864A>G (p.Tyr955Cys), morphologically investigated and diagnosed using a skeletal muscle biopsy. The aim of this presentation is to emphasize the diagnostic value of the muscle biopsy both in cases of clinical suspicion and in more challenging cases of mitochondrial diseases with atypical or unusual features. Although genetic testing may be the initial test of choice in cases with suggestive clinical presentation, muscle biopsy is an alternative diagnostic aid with high value even in our molecular era. We present pathological and ultrastructural data to confirm the diagnosis.",0

"Mitochondriopathies are a heterogeneous group of genetic diseases of children and adults, with a very diverse clinical presentation, involving a single organ or, even more frequently, multisystemic, making the diagnostic workup a real challenge. Their worldwide prevalence is estimated to range between 1/5000 and 1/8500, with many undiagnosed cases worldwide. This group of diseases is the result of dysfunctions of the mitochondrial respiratory chain [1]. The clinical symptoms have a large variability and generally, the more severe phenotypes have an early onset, even from the neonatal period, while milder ones manifest later in the adulthood.",0
"The most important types of mitochondriopathies are mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), Leigh syndrome (subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy), myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF), autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive–progressive external ophthalmoplegia (ad/ar–PEO), Alpers disease (epilepsy with liver failure), sensory ataxic neuropathy, dysarthria and ophthalmoparesis (SANDO), Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP), and Kearns–Sayre syndrome (KSS).",0
"The mitochondrion is the location of energy production in the cell (through oxidative phosphorylation). This process has dual genetic control as it is regulated by genes in both mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA (nDNA), thus, mitochondrial myopathies are produced by mutations in the nuclear or mitochondrial genome. Mitochondria are ubiquitous in all tissues except for red blood cells and this is the explanation why clinical features manifest typically in tissues with high-energy requirements like brain, skeletal muscles, myocardium or endocrine organs. Over 1500 mitochondrial proteins and 37 mitochondrial genes are currently known.",0
"Most publications have already demonstrated deletions or point mutations in mtDNA, but in recent years, the field of investigation has expanded to syndromes caused by mutations in the nDNA, with a Mendelian inheritance [2]. The first mutations in nDNA, associated with secondary multiple deletions in mtDNA were described in 1999 by Nishino et al. [3]. They caused an autosomal recessive disease, mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE). It was followed by the discovery of ISSN (print) 1220–0522 ISSN (online) 2066–8279",0
"other nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial pathology, like PEO with Mendelian inheritance. Most nDNA mutations are autosomal recessive, but there are also few autosomal dominant, and two mutations are linked to chromosome X [2].",0
"PEO, chronic PEO (CPEO) or autosomal dominant PEO1 (adPEO1) mitochondriopathy is a mitochondrial disease with CPEO, caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in nDNA, DNA polymerase subunit gamma (POLG) gene, on chromosome 15q25, with a Mendelian transmission. This gene encodes for the catalytic subunit of the mtDNA polymerase (pol-γ) and the disorders produced by a mutation in POLG gene may be inherited both in a recessive and a dominant way [4, 5]. Defects in pol-γ lead to multiple mtDNA deletions. Less commonly, similar mutations may cause mtDNA depletion [6]. The precise molecular mechanisms underlying such variability have not yet been deciphered [7].",0
"PEO is clinically characterized by onset between 18 and 40 years old, ptosis and weakening of the external eye muscles, blepharoptosis and ophthalmoparesis. Weakness and wasting of proximal limb muscles and exercise intolerance are also associated with PEO.",0
"We present a rare case of adult onset PEO1 due to an autosomal dominant mutation in nDNA encoding for POLG on chromosome 15q25, with a definitive molecular genetic confirmation achieved after a histopathological recognition of the mitochondrial abnormalities. Our case demonstrates that a muscle biopsy with optimal processing of the tissue may be a key diagnostic tool that can establish a fast and accurate diagnosis and direct molecular genetic testing in these diseases with incredible phenotypic and genetic diversity.  Case presentation",0
"The patient is a 49-year-old man (PN) from urban area, with higher education and professional activity, with unremarkable past medical history, who presented three years ago to the Hospital (Department of Neurology, “Colentina” Clinical Hospital, Bucharest, Romania, Medical Record No. 104553/2015) for a specialized medical consultation because of progressive bilateral eye weakness and fatigue with drooped eyelids, without diurnal variation of the symptoms and slight difficulty in swallowing (Figure 1).",1
"Figure 1 – Ophthalmoplegia of the patient, in 2014: progressive bilateral eye weakness and fatigue with drooped eyelids. His 63-year-old brother and 88-year-old mother have no similar problems. His father died when the patient was a small child, but did not show any sign of neuromuscular disease throughout his life. Nobody else in the family ever experienced similar symptoms. Both ophthalmoplegia and dysphagia have evolved over time (Figure 2). Thinking retrospectively and analyzing photographs from his personal",1
"archive, the patient realized that the symptoms actually started many years in advance, probably around the age of 35, but remained unnoticed. The patient also had a mild and very slowly progressive proximal limb weakness. Figure 2 – Evolution of ophthalmoplegia over time – years 2005 (a), 2007 (b), and 2011 (c). The first clinical diagnosis suspected by the ophthalmologist and then neurologist was myasthenia gravis, but anti-acetylcholine receptor and anti-musclespecific kinase (MuSK) receptor antibody levels were normal.",1
"Other investigations like computed tomography scan, spirometry, electromyography and Doppler ultrasound were also performed at that time, without conclusive results. Serum creatine kinase level was mildly elevated. After injection of Pyridostigmine (Mestinon), the eyelid lifting effect was insignificant, however he received corticosteroid treatment and Neostigmine for nine months, without any clinical improvement. After discontinuing treatment for several days on his own initiative, the patient did not experienced any worsening of the symptoms, however he continued the prescribed treatment with Neostigmine and intermittent corticotherapy. Persistence of symptoms urged him to continue the investigations. Another consultation at the Department of Neurology, University Emergency Hospital, Bucharest, raised the clinical suspicion of oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, based on the association of ptosis with dysphagia and a muscular biopsy was recommended to confirm the clinical diagnosis. It is important to note that a possible diagnosis of mitochondrial disease was never clinically suspected before performing the muscle biopsy.",1
"An open muscle biopsy from the left deltoid muscle under local anesthesia using Lidocaine subcutaneous injection was performed at “Colentina” Clinical Hospital, Bucharest, after informed consent of the patient for the procedure was obtained, the muscle tissue processing being accomplished in the Department of Pathology of the same Hospital.",0
"A skeletal muscle tissue fragment was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen cooled isopentane. Following the orientation of the muscle, transversal 8 μm thickness cryosections were obtained. They were processed and stained for examination with histology and histochemistry techniques [Hematoxylin–Eosin (HE), van Gieson, modified Gömöri trichrome (GT), Sudan BB, Periodic Acid–Schiff (PAS)] and enzyme histochemical preparation for reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide tetrazolium reductase (NADH-TR), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) at pH 9.4, 4.63 and 4.35. After muscle sections examination in light microscopy, a cytochrome oxidase IV investigation using the cytochrome c oxidase (COX) or complex IV reaction and a combined COX–SDH staining were ordered, due to the presence of ragged-red fibers on GT and HE stainings.",1
"Another small longitudinal of 0.5 mm length fragment of muscle tissue was fixed in buffered 2.5% glutaraldehyde, embedded in Epon 812 resin after osmication; semithin and ultrathin sections were obtained and contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate for ultrastructural examination.",0
"A separate piece of muscle tissue was formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, and the sections were stained with HE. On examination in light microscopy, the striated muscle tissue fragment had a well-preserved overall architecture, but an obvious fiber size variation, with scattered elongated, isolated atrophic fibers (Figure 3). Very rare, more intensely",0
"colored fibers or fibers with a clear external rim were noticed on HE staining (Figure 4), with a granular aspect and a fine reddish border/red rim and irregular sarcoplasm on GT staining, giving a “ragged-red” appearance and with more intense reaction on oxidative enzyme stainings (Figure 5). The “ragged-red“ fibers were hyper-reactive and stained darkly with SDH (Figure 6), the most sensitive staining for detecting mitochondrial proliferation, appearing as “ragged-blue“ fibers. These fibers were COX-negative. A dominance of type I muscle fibers and small clusters of type II fibers had also been observed (Figure 7). Increased focal punctate lipid inclusions within some of the myofibers were highlighted by Sudan BB staining (Figure 8), and PAS staining was more prominent in several fibers (Figure 9). The COX reaction showed obvious scattered negative muscle fibers lacking COX activity (Figure 10), staining blue with the combined COX–SDH staining, a clearly pathological aspect as in normal biopsies all fibers have staining for COX. These findings were diagnostic of mitochondrial myopathy and ultrastructural examination was further performed. The clinical suspicion of oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy based on the association of ptosis with dysphagia could be ruled out by the absence of rimmed cytoplasmic vacuoles or other morphological aspects described in this disease and identification of ragged-red/ragged-blue fibers highly suggestive for a mitochondrial disease. The remaining muscle tissue was stored at -800C in a deep freezer.",1

Receiving a pathological diagnosis, which refers to a genetic progressive disease, the patient became very anxious and concerned about the risk that his single 14-year-old healthy son might eventually inherit the disease. For genetic confirmation and counseling, a DNA sample extracted from the patient’s blood was prepared for genetic analysis in May 2016 and was sent to Belgium, at the Center for Medical Genetics, UZ Brussel.",0
The first genetic tests addressed to the mitochondrial genome and did not identify any abnormality.,0
"At this stage of the diagnostic approach, the genetic testing has been extended in August 2016 to nDNA analysis using the panel for mitochondrial diseases and identified a mutation in the POLG gene, the pathogenic variant c.2864A>G (p.Tyr955Cys) in January 2017. Sequencing analysis with massive parallel sequencing of the coding exons and part of the flanking introns of the genes included in mitochondrial disease gene panel (target capture Roche) was performed. This mutation has been associated in literature with dominant PEO and PEO with Parkinson. Using genetic testing, the clinical suspicion of a mitochondrial disease was confirmed, with the identification of an autosomal dominant gene defect in POLG. All siblings and children of this patient have an estimated risk of 50% to be affected. Genetic counseling of the patient is now essential.",1
"Our patient currently performs normal physical and professional activity while scheduling surgery to correct ptosis and for the time, being decided to postpone his son’s genetic testing. Studying the ophthalmological literature, the patient also designed and made himself special crutches attached to his glasses to keep the eyelids elevated.  Discussions Clinical diagnosis of mitochondrial disorders is complicated by various phenotypes that lead to dysfunctions of almost any organ [8].",0
PEO is a common manifestation of a mitochondrial disease with onset in adulthood and is usually associated with either primary mtDNA mutations or secondary mtDNA defects caused by mutations in nDNA (with effect in disrupting mtDNA maintenance). Many patients do not have a genetic diagnosis but have multiple deletions of mtDNA in skeletal muscle. Extremely rare cases of PEO without ptosis or late onset eyelid ptosis in the disease course were also described. Both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance can occur; autosomal recessive inheritance is usually more severe [9].,0
The most common clinical features in PEO1 are weakness of the external eye muscles and exercise,0
"intolerance, with rare and variable additional symptoms including cataract, sensory axonal neuropathy, ataxia, hearing loss, depression, hypogonadism, and parkinsonism. Fortunately, none of these possible additional signs have been observed in our patient. Besides the eye symptoms, our patient had progressive dysphagia with a gradual degradation of swallowing. It is important to take into account the presence of all gastrointestinal manifestations in mitochondrial diseases diagnosis (e.g., the motility disorders). Dysphagia can be caused by either central nervous system (CNS) involvement, peripheral nerves, or involvement of smooth muscle cells. This phenomenon is common in mitochondrial disease [10]. One of the most important measures in treating dysphagia in mitochondrial diseases is avoidance of toxic drugs for mitochondrion, such as Dichloroacetate, Linezolid, Chloramphenicol, aminoglycosides, Valproic acid, Carbamazepine, Phenobarbital, statins or nucleoside reverse transcriptase (NRT) inhibitors, aspects which are not well known or taken into account by many physicians [11].",0
"A genetic diagnosis can lead to the avoidance of muscle biopsy, but many cases, with or without a genetic diagnosis, require a muscular biopsy for confirmation, especially the cases of unknown mutations. Skeletal muscle is considered to be the best tissue to confirm a mitochondrial myopathy using histochemical and biochemical tests that can be done on tissue: COX (complex IV) activity and SDH (complex II) activity [12]. Some authors demonstrated that different mitochondrial syndromes have contrasting histochemical features, with ragged-red fibers and COX-negative fibers being more prevalent in PEO than in MERRF syndrome or MELAS [13]. Negative COX muscle fibers may suggest a mitochondrial genetic problem that requires further investigations of specific gene panels, exosome sequencing or whole genome sequencing [14].",0
"A main pathological challenge is to perform the muscle biopsy and process the tissue using standardized protocols to preserve not only morphology of mitochondria, but also the enzymatic activity and genetic content of the tissue to allow further specific investigations, like mitochondrial respiratory chain studies, essential in these diseases. This requirement can be achieved only through a multidisciplinary approach, including surgeon, clinician and pathologist. Actual protocols require a small fragment of fresh muscle collected in ribonuclease (RNase) free tubes to be snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for biochemistry and genetic testing [15].",0
"Not only processing, but also interpretation of morphological findings in mitochondriopathies is difficult because the histological and histochemical features are not entirely specific. Separating primary from secondary abnormalities of mitochondria implies integrations of the morphological findings in the clinical picture. The “ragged-red” fibers, considered to be the morphological hallmark of mitochondrial myopathy, are characterized by subsarcolemmal and intermyofibrillar accumulations of mitochondria with replacement of some of the contractile elements. However, “ragged-red” fibers are not pathognomonic and can be identified on muscle biopsies with aging, in hereditary non-mitochondrial diseases, in cases of toxic or inflammatory myopathies, especially inclusion body myositis",0
"or in Zidovudine-associated myopathy of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients [16]. In recent publications, scattered “ragged-red” fibers were also described in cases of myofibrillar myopathies, where their presence can be explained by the functional interactions of intermediate filaments and mitochondria in the complex muscle fiber architecture [17].",0
"“Ragged-red” fibers are often, but not always, COXnegative. Additionally, “ragged-red” fibers and COXdeficient fibers are not identified in all cases of mitochondrial myopathy and are more frequently associated with mutations in mtDNA rather than in the nuclear genes, but in our case both key morphological features were present on the biopsy. In children, COX-deficient fibers may be more numerous than the “ragged-red” ones, or may be the only abnormality in the muscle biopsy [18, 19]. Sometimes, no morphological abnormality is noticed on the muscle biopsy, but this cannot clearly rule out a clinical suspicion of mitochondriopathy.",0
"In skeletal muscle, it is important that there is a strong correlation between mitochondrial function and ultrastructure [20–22]. An important number of enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (and not only) are found in mitochondrial cristae and any morphological abnormality in this area leads to physiological disturbances and alteration of the signaling pathways in which these enzymes are involved.",0
"A classic feature of mitochondrial myopathy is the subsarcolemmal accumulation of abnormal mitochondria, demonstrated by electron microscopy images, but also by optical microscopy, on SDH staining (as “ragged-blue” fibers) or modified GT staining (“ragged-red” fibers). Electron microscopy is an essential confirmation of mitochondriopathy. Moreover, it may add extra data in cases where histology and histochemistry are not eloquent, or not enough “ragged-red”/“ragged-blue” fibers are found, or there are no COX-negative fibers in the biopsy sample.",0
"In mitochondria with concentric cristae, the width of the intracristae space was reduced by about 15%, indicating a thickening of cristae membranes. Moreover, the distance between two adjacent cristae is substantially reduced in this type of mitochondria, as Vincent et al. showed [23]. Same pathological electron-dense bodies in mitochondria encountered in our patient’s biopsy were also observed by Suomalainen et al. in extraocular muscle from a PEO patient with mtDNA deletions and brain involvement [24]. The significance is yet unknown.",0
"Concerning the correlation of histology with genetic results, there is no specific morphological abnormalities typical for a certain genetic mutation. Each cell contains many mitochondria and each mitochondrion contains many genomes. There is a phenomenon of genetic heteroplasmia, where a proportion of genomes contain the mutation, and a proportion represents the wild type.",0
"Our case illustrates the complexity of positive and differential diagnosis in mitochondriopathies, presenting a mitochondrial disease caused by an autosomal dominant nDNA mutation on chromosome 15 in 15q26.1, which causes mtDNA deletions [25]. This mutation is associated with PEO. Added to PEO, our patient had also swallowing difficulties. Over 1500 nuclear genetic loci encode for",0
"mitochondrial proteins, which are not only involved in oxidative phosphorylation but also in many other functions of mitochondria, and about 15% of the mitochondrial proteome awaits identification [26]. PEO caused by mutation in the POLG gene is associated with more severe phenotypes than those forms caused by mutation in the adenine nucleotide translocator 1 (ANT1) gene [PEO with mtDNA deletions, autosomal dominant 2 (PEOA2)] or C10ORF2 gene (PEOA3) [5]. Mutations in nDNA that affect mitochondria are very diverse and even include mtDNA defects (which are responsible for maintenance, replication, and translation). nDNA mutations can lead to apoptosis, changes in mitochondrial metabolism or mitochondrial chaperones damage [1]. POLG gene sequencing in patients with mitochondrial disease with PEO is helpful for a diagnosis confirmation. Most of that, the carrier testing, prenatal diagnosis and pre-symptomatic testing of the siblings are needed.",0
 Conclusions,0
"A precise diagnosis in mitochondrial disorders has important clinical implications and helps in providing an adequate genetic counseling. Performing a muscle biopsy must be considered in the diagnostic workup in order to confirm a mitochondriopathy, in strong correlation with clinical features, and guide genetic testing for nDNA and mtDNA to identify where the primary mutation is located. The identification of defects in mitochondrial or nuclear genome leads to the conclusive diagnosis of mitochondrial myopathy. The main morphological features of mitochondriopathies are the presence of “ragged-red”/ “ragged-blue” fibers and decreased COX activity. Electron microscopy can confirm the histopathological findings by highlighting subsarcolemmal accumulation of abnormally structured mitochondria. The utility of muscle biopsy is obvious considering that genetic testing in mitochondriopathies is complex and sometimes not easily available. A real challenge of the current period is finding therapies that may slow the progression of these diseases, while further studies are required in the next years for a better understanding of all the factors interacting in the “crosstalk” between the mitochondrial and the nuclear genomes and their implications for the spectrum of human mitochondrial diseases.",0

"Polymerase gamma (POLG) is a nuclear gene that encodes mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (pol c). It is the only polymerase for mitochondrial DNA(mtDNA) replication and repair [1]. Dysfunction of pol c results in impaired integrity of mtDNA, including to depletion or deletion, eventually leading to diminution of mitochondrial energy with disorders of oxidative phosphorylation [2]. The spectrum of phenotypes caused by the mutation of POLG is broad, which include Alpers syndrome, progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), limb myopathy, parkinsonism, epilepsy and other multi-systemic features [3]. The first 2 cases of parkinsonism with POLG mutation were reported in 2004, by Michelangelo Mancuso [4]. Here, we report another case of a female patient carrying a novel compound heterozygotic missense mutation in POLG.",1
Case presentation The 29 year-old Chinese female patient developed right upper limb mixed rest and postural tremor at,1
"the age of 16. The tremor gradually progressed to left upper limb, lower extremities and the head. Two years later, she showed signs of parkinsonism including bradykinesia and shuffling gait. Treatment with benserazide/levodopa 25/100 mg bid and benzhexol hydrochloride 2 mg tid significantly improved tremor and bradykinesia, however, soon accompanied with severe peak-dose dyskinesia. With time the patient showed end-of-dose deterioration effect, and selfadjusted benserazide/levodopa’s dose to 12.5/50 mg q2h (about 150/600 mg per day) which helped to relieve the fluctuation. At 23 years of age, the patient developed signs of slowly progressive bilateral ptosis, and a year later, her symptoms significantly aggravated, with frequent falls because of dyskinesia and postural instability, along with development of diplopia, dysarthria and dysphagia. The patient also reported presence of mild muscles weakness and exercise intolerance conditions.",1

"Neurological examination revealed cognitive deficits, with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score of 16/30 (decline in calculation and delayed recall). Hypophonia, hypomimia, bilateral blepharoptosis and external ophthalmoplegia with diplopia were found. Presence of hypopsia (Vision acuity: right 0.05, left counting fingers/2 centimeters), mild symmetrical proximal muscle weakness (Medical Research Council grade 4/5), with diminished deep tendon reflexes was found. Presence of rest tremor in all limbs, slowing and amplitude decrements during finger tapping and hand pronation-supination movements, and postural instability were found. Reduced bilateral arm swing during walking could be seen. The patient had a positive response to levodopa accompanied by peak-dose dyskinesia in limbs and trunk.",1
Fundoscopy revealed bilateral optic atrophy. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed retinal nerve fiber layer thickness loss. Brain MRI displayed diffuse cortical atrophy. Reduced striatal 11 C-b-CFT uptake was seen in the bilateral putamen and caudate on DaT scan. FDG-PET scan showed hypometabolism in parietal and occipital lobe. Muscle biopsy specimen obtained from the biceps brachii muscle revealed specific changes with ragged red fibers (Figure 1).,1
"Total DNA was extracted by using DNA extraction kit (made by Qiagen, DNeasy Blood &Tissue Kit) from blood. Specific DNA probes were customized according to NCBI. Whole exons (including nuclear genomes and mitochondrial DNA) were sequenced by Southern blot and PCR. No mutations were found in any of the recessive genes associated with early-onset Parkinson’s disease, such as pakin, PINK1, DJ-1. While a novel heterozygous c.2693T > C (p.I898T) (Figure 2) mutation was found in exon17 of POLG. The patient’s mother also carried the same heterozygous mutation but her father was wild type. Another heterozygous point",1

"Parkinsonism features have been reported as a late complication of POLG-associated dominant PEO [4, 6–9]. While our patient developed parkinsonism symptoms about 5 years prior to PEO. In addition, this patient suffered from severely decreased visual acuity, loss in retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and optic atrophy, which is extremely rare in cases with POLG mutation. Only one case reported by Margherita Milone [10] presented with optic atrophy carried a splice-site mutation in intron 18 of POLG (c.3104 þ 3A > T), accompanied with ptosis, ophthalmoparesis and dysphagia. However, the major difference from our case was the lack of parkinsonism.",1
"The mutation c.2993C > T (p.S998L) has been described previously, besides, in that case the patient was reported to have two heterozygous nucleotide substitutions: c.2993C > T (p.998S > L) and c.3550G > C (p.1184D > H). The dominant features of that patient were bilateral ptosis, external ophthalmoplegia and progressive encephalopathy. Our patient on the other hand carried another novel mutation c.2693T > C (p.I898T) INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE 321",0
"and her dominant symptoms were parkinsonism, external ophthalmoplegia, optic atrophy, which are obviously different from the patient reported before. Conclusion We reported a patient carrying a novel compound heterozygotic missense mutation in POLG(c.2993C > T (p.998S > L) and c.2693T > C (p.I898T)). And c.2693T > C (p.I898T) to our knowledge has never been reported before. This finding of ours has broadened the spectrum of phenotype caused by the mutation of POLG1.

"A 3-year-old girl presented with severe epilepsy in the context of Borrelia infection. After ceftriaxone/lidocaine administration, she showed secondarily generalized focal crises that led to neurological and motor sequelae. Genetic studies identified in the patient two heterozygous POLG mutations (c.2591A>G; p.Asn864Ser and c.3649G>C; p.Ala1217Pro). Through analysis of POLG activity in cultured fibroblasts, we confirmed that the mutations altered the mtDNA turnover. Moreover, patient fibroblasts were more sensitive than controls in the presence of a mitochondrial replication-affecting drug, the antiretroviral azidothymidine. To test if ceftriaxone treatment could worsen the deleterious effect of the patient mutations, toxicity assays were performed. Cell toxicity, without direct effect on mitochondrial respiratory function, was detected at different antibiotic concentrations. The clinical outcome, together with the different in vitro sensitivity to ceftriaxone among patient and control cells, suggested that the mitochondrial disease symptoms were hastened by the infection and were possibly worsened by the pharmacological treatment. This study underscores the benefit of early genetic diagnosis of the patients with mitochondrial diseases, since they may be a target group of patients especially vulnerable to environmental factors.",1

"depletion and impairment of cellular metabolism. The pol γ holoenzyme consists of a catalytic subunit (encoded by POLG), which possesses both polymerase and proofreading exonuclease activities in separate domains, and a dimeric form of its accessory subunit (encoded by POLG2), which increases enzyme processivity [2].",0
"In 2001, the first disease mutations were identified in POLG [3]. Since then, over 200 mutations in POLG have been associated with mitochondrial diseases (http://tools.niehs. nih. gov/polg/) [4–6]. The identification of disease-causing POLG mutations is challenging because POLG gene locus is highly polymorphic and the appearance of disease symptoms can be dependent on epigenetic and environmental factors [5, 7]. Pathogenic mutations have been found to affect the activity of the polymerase, the fidelity of replication, and the formation of the holoenzyme [2]. The clinical identification of POLG-related diseases is difficult because patients present an overlapping range of symptoms and signs with multiple organ system involvement and with variable severity [6]. Clinical phenotype expresses habitually in the central and peripheral nervous, musculoskeletal, and gastrointestinal systems [5, 6, 8]. The disease onset is very variable, ranging from infancy to late adulthood, being the most frequent age of onset during childhood and adolescence. Both autosomal dominant",0
and recessive transmission have been documented for POLG deficient patients [4].,0
"Environmental factors, like infection or pharmacological treatment, can precipitate the onset of POLG disease. For example, infection with human herpesvirus 6 unmasked the POLG mutation phenotypes in two young children, contributing to a more rapid clinical deterioration [9]. The use of antiviral therapies based on nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) provides an example of pharmacological induction of a POLG disease phenotype, since inhibition of mitochondrial pol γ is a common side effect of NRTIs, leading to azidothymidine (AZT)-induced mtDNA depletion [10–12]. Thus, certain POLG mutations facilitate the NRTI-induced toxicity [13, 14].",0
Here we report the identification of two POLG mutations in a 3-year-old girl that presented with severe epilepsy in the context of an infectious process and developed sudden neurological signs during the treatment of the infection. We analyze the pathogenicity of the POLG mutations encountered in the patient and analyze the possible contribution of the pharmacological treatment to the disease progression.

Intramuscular treatment with ceftriaxone/lidocaine was indicated, and after that, she presented an episode of secondarily generalized focal crisis, hypertonia, and myoclonus of the 4 limbs. After 4 days, she was discharged from the hospital maintaining an adequate level of consciousness and motor skills. After the second ceftriaxone/ lidocaine injection, she presented again a new secondarily generalized focal crisis refractory to treatment associating consciousness level and motor deterioration. A single high blood lactate value was reported (4.9 mmol/l: reference values (RV), < 2.0 mmol/l). Neuroimaging studies disclosed an increase of the subarachnoid space at the frontoparietal level and an atrophy of the left hemisphere. Pale eye fundus was also observed. Treatment with phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and leviracetam led to seizure control. She occasionally presented motor focal seizures and upper extremity myoclonus. At 4 years of age, she was admitted to the neuropediatric department of our hospital and she presented with encephalopathy and motor disturbances including inexpressive facies, facial hypomimia, axial hypotonia, hypo/areflexia, distal limb increased tone, and right tetraparesis. She had lost deambulation and disclosed difficulties in handling objects. Drooling was also observed.

"c, d), indicating that the combination of the two recessive variations present in the patient has a milder effect than the dominant p.Y955C variant.",0
"To determine the rate of depletion and repopulation of mtDNA in the fibroblasts, cells were exposed to EtBr during 8 days and let recover for 12 days (Fig. 1f). EtBr-induced mtDNA depletion occurred at the same rate in all cell lines, C, P, and PPOLG-WT. By contrast, the restoration of mtDNA levels was markedly delayed in P cells, whereas PPOLG-WT showed the same repopulation profile than C cells. These results strongly suggested that the capacity for adequate mtDNA turnover in patient fibroblasts is compromised by the combination of the two recessive POLG mutations. Moreover, they indicate that the treatment with a mitochondrial stressor (EtBr) can unmask the POLG deficient phenotype of the patient.",0
"The effect of the nucleoside analog AZTon the growth of C and P cell lines was next tested. The presence of 10 μM AZT did not have any significant effect on the growth of control cells (C), but significantly reduced the growth of patient fibroblasts after 6, 8, and 10 days in the presence of the drug (Fig. 1g). A second ageand passage-matched control fibroblast cell line (C3) did not show reduced growth either, when exposed to 10 μM AZT (Fig. 1g). This result shows that POLG mutations encountered in the patient make cells more susceptible to the presence of POLG stressors, reinforcing their pathogenic nature.",0
Ceftriaxone exposure induces toxicity in fibroblasts,0
"When C and P cells were exposed to the anesthetic lidocaine, the cellular respiration (O2 consumption) showed the same dose-dependent inhibition in both cell lines (50% inhibition at ~ 4.5 mM) (Fig. 2a). The values were similar to those reported in isolated pig mitochondria [30]. Since we did not detect in vitro inhibition of cellular respiration below 100 μM, and the published concentration of lidocaine with effect on human fibroblast proliferation and viability is above 300 μg/ml [31], much higher than plasma doses [32], a severe impact of this drug in the patient disease progression was excluded.",0
"The addition of ceftriaxone did not inhibited P or C cellular respiration when added to the polarography chamber up to a concentration of 1500 μg/ml (ten times higher than the maximum patient plasma concentration, 141 μg/ml) [32] (Fig. 2b). This excludes a direct effect of the antibiotic on respiratory function. To analyze a longer-term impact, we tested the effect of ceftriaxone on cell growth over 8-day period. Cells were cultured in galactose-based medium to facilitate the detection of defects in oxidative phosphorylation [28]. The growth of patient cells was reduced in the presence of 150 μg/ml ceftriaxone, after 2, 6, or 8 days of treatment when compared with untreated cells. Although this reduction was not statistically significant, it was higher than that for the ageand passage-",0

The values are expressed in picomoles of O2 per second per million cells. b Oxygen uptake of control (C) and patient (P) fibroblasts in the presence of increasing doses of ceftriaxone.

"matched control cell line (C3) (18% vs. 6% at 8 days) (Fig. 2c). Higher ceftriaxone concentration, 300 μg/ml, caused a higher reduction (42% at 8 days) of P cells, indicating a dose-dependent effect of the drug (Fig. 2c). The number of P cells was significantly reduced when compared with the untreated cells after 2, 6, or 8 days in the presence of 300 μg/ml ceftriaxone, whereas C3 cells were significantly reduced only after 8 days (Fig. 2c). These results indicated higher sensibility of the patient to the drug. Discussion",0
"In the case presented here, a 3-year-old girl experienced severe consciousness level and motor manifestations during the treatment of an infection with Borrelia sp. and was found to have an underlying POLG-related mitochondrial disease. The c.2591A>G; p.Asn864Ser variant was previously reported in heterozygosis in two 15-year-old sisters with mitochondrial disease [ 26 ]. The second variant ( c. 3649 G>C; p.Ala1217Pro) has not been previously associated with disease. Both variants involve highly conserved amino acid residues, which suggest having important functional roles. Proving the pathogenic nature of novel POLG mutations is a major challenge because the POLG locus is highly polymorphic and the disease manifestation is often dependent on epigenetic and environmental factors [5, 7]. POLG-related",1
"diseases are expected to share mtDNA depletion as a common pathogenetic feature, possibly in combination with mtDNA damage including multiple deletions and increased burden of point mutations. However, mtDNA depletion assays can be misleading in the diagnosis because mtDNA copy number is highly variable among different tissues [33] and mtDNA depletion is not always present, especially in the early stages of the disease [34]. Furthermore, in POLG-related epilepsy, myopathy is not a common clinical feature and normal muscle and fibroblast studies do not exclude the diagnosis of POLGrelated mitochondrial disease [35]. Therefore, although quantitative mtDNA depletion was not detected in patient muscle at the time when the clinical symptoms appear, we further evaluated patient POLG performance in cell culture [7]. Patient skin fibroblasts showed delayed rate of mtDNA repopulation after induced depletion, when compared with canonical POLG overexpressing patient cells or with control fibroblasts, an established criterion of pathogenicity [7]. These results indicated that the combination of the two recessive patient variations in POLG polymerase domain is pathogenic. CIV activity reduction was not detected in patient fibroblasts, probably because it lowers only with severe depletion.",0
"There are a few well-established examples of drug-induced mitochondrial disorders. Patients treated with antiviral nucleoside analogs (NRTIs), such as AZT, developed a mitochondrial myopathy characterized by the appearance of ragged-red fibers and cytochrome oxidase–negative fibers [12]. Although",0
"the NRTIs, like AZT, are designed to inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase, its incorporation inhibits mitochondrial pol γ replication inducing mitochondrial toxicity as a major adverse effect. In our in vitro assays, AZT 10 μM had little or no effect on control skin fibroblast proliferation, as published previously [36]. However, the patient POLG mutations facilitated the AZT-induced toxicity and increased 11% the doubling time of the cells. This effect that has been previously described in a cell line with other POLG mutations [13, 14] corroborates the deleterious nature of our patient mutations.",0
"Progression of symptoms and deterioration of mitochondrial disorders in association with an intercurrent illness have been well described [5]. In our patient, IgM anti-Borrelia titers were high suggesting that infection with Borrelia sp. was an important event in the onset of the symptoms of mitochondrial pathology. Interestingly, Borrelia spp. are dependent on purine salvage pathway from the host environment for survival",0
"[37] and therefore could be an additional stress factor for a patient with compromised mtDNA synthesis. In a previous case, the onset of Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) in a young patient appeared in association with Borrelia infection [38]. In other case, a woman with antibodies against Borrelia sp. in serum developed dropped head syndrome (DHS) that was attributed to an underlying multiorgan mitochondriopathy [39]. Remarkably, our patient presented an episode of secondarily generalized focal crisis, hypertonia, and myoclonus of the 4 limbs and Borrelia sp. infection has been frequently associated with myoclonus [40–42].",0
"During her hospital admission, our patient suddenly worsened with the administration of ceftriaxone/lidocaine. Cefalosporin antibiotics, as well as the anesthetic lidocaine, have being previously associated with mitochondrial toxicity. Lidocain inhibits the electron transport chain, although the exact mechanism involved in its cytotoxicity is not well established [30, 43, 44]. The in vitro exposure of patient fibroblasts to lidocaine excluded a severe impact of this drug at the therapeutic dose. The antibiotic treatment, on the contrary, could have been a key environmental factor that worsened the underlying mitochondrial disease of the patient. In our in vitro assays, patient skin fibroblasts were more susceptible to longterm culture in the presence of the drug than controls. More importantly, ceftriaxone and other cephalosporin antibiotics have been associated with serious central nervous system side effects including mainly encephalopathy, convulsion, and myoclonia [45–48].",0
"In summary, we report a clinical case of POLG-related mitochondrial disease hastened by environmental stress, infectious, and therapeutic. This case highlights the importance of early genetic diagnoses of the patients and the necessity of consideration of risks and benefits in the selection of pharmacological treatment for patients with suspected mitochondrial disorders.",0

"Patients with mutations in the POLG-1 gene often are afﬂicted with drug-resistant seizures at an early age and have an increased risk of valproic acid-induced acute liver failure. Severe valproate hepatotoxicity most commonly arises in children within the ﬁrst 3 months of treatment with an overall estimated incidence of 1 in 40,000 treated patients. Due to high mortality rates among transplanted children, many experts consider valproic acid-induced acute liver failure in patients with mitochondrial disorders to be a contraindication to liver transplant. We report the successful use of liver transplantation in a young man with valproic acid-associated acute liver failure harboring a previously unrecognized POLG-1 mutation.",0

"Valproic acid (VPA) is a widely used branched, medium chain fatty acid that was approved as a treatment for patients with epilepsy in 1978. Due to its other beneﬁts, VPA has also received United States Food and Drug Administration approval for use in patients with bipolar disorders and recurrent migraine headaches [1]. The use of VPA in epilepsy patients is guided by the clinical response, blood levels, and dose-dependent side effects. VPA can cause several distinctive forms of acute and chronic hepatic injury in treated patients [2–5].",0
"The most common form of injury to the liver is mild elevation in serum AST and ALT levels that occur in up to 5 to 10% of treated patients within 12 months. The frequency and severity of these self-limited aminotransferase elevations do not appear to be related to subject age, gender, or race nor the dose of VPA administered or peak serum VPA level. VPA can also interfere with intracellular ammonia metabolism and lead to a systemic hyperammonemia syndrome with associated mental status changes despite normal hepatic enzymes and bilirubin levels. Hyperammonemia is most commonly seen during the ﬁrst 6 months of therapy but can occur later in treatment with dose escalations and usually resolves with either holding or reducing the dose of VPA or by giving L-carnitine supplementation [6]. The third and least common phenotype of VPA-mediated injury to the liver is acute hepatocellular",0

A 20-year-old previously healthy caucasian male experienced multiple focal aware-motor seizures involving the left upper and lower extremity in July 2017 after initiating boot camp exercises as a military recruit. He subsequently developed generalized motor seizures. His past medical history and family history were negative for epilepsy and he was receiving no antiseizure medication. The patient underwent an extensive medical evaluation including an MRI of the brain that showed bilateral multifocal areas of gyriform-restricted diffusion with associated cortical thickening and T2/FLAIR hyperintensity most pronounced in the posterior right frontal lobe. He had an EEG performed that,1

"showed focal motor status epilepticus emanating from the right frontal region associated wtih myoclonic jerks. The patient underwent a lumbar puncture that showed elevated protein and B2 microglobulin. For the diagnosis of focal motor status epilepticus, the patient was treated with a series of antiseizure medications including levetiracetam, phenytoin, and lacosamide. However, due to progressive neurological symptoms including persistent left upper and lower extremity focal seizures, mental status ﬂuctuations and weakness, he required hospitalization and was diagnosed with presumed autoimmune encephalopathy based on results of the above studies and after a PET scan showed large areas of hypermetabolic activity in the right parietal lobe, thalamus and left cerebellum. A cerebral angiogram was unremarkable without evidence of vasculitis. He was given immunoglobulin, plasma exchange, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil and rituximab infusions as well as high dose corticosteroids. CSF testing for the presence of anti-NMDA antibodies was negative. The patient's seizures eventually were controlled with the addition of valproic acid that was initiated in October 2017 at a dose of 1000 mg/day. Of note, his pretreatment liver biochemical analyses were normal. Follow-up lab work in December 2017 demonstrated a serum AST of 28 IU/L and ALT of 73 IU/L with total bilirubin of 0.6 mg/dl and his valproate dose was increased to 1500 mg per day due to a low serum concentration (Fig. 1). In January 2018 the patient developed extreme fatigue, lethargy, and nausea with vomiting and subsequent jaundice, mental status changes and coagulopathy. At the time of hospitalization he had a serum AST 161 IU/L, ALT 283 IU/L bilirubin 4.5 mg/dl and INR of 3.1 with no eosinophilia. His initial NH3 level was elevated at 70 μg/dl in Nov 2017 and remained elevated at 60 μg/dl in January 2018. Evaluation for hepatitis A, B, C and CMV/EBV infection was negative as was liver imaging. A liver biopsy showed marked microvascular steatosis and associated necrosis consistent with drug-induced hepatotoxicity. Despite discontinuation of VPA and use of N-acetylcysteine, his liver function continued to decline and he underwent emergency orthotopic liver transplantation",1
in February 2018. His explanted liver weighed 1332 g and demonstrated regenerative nodules with extensive necrosis and early cirrhosis on trichrome stain (Fig. 2). Post-operative genetic testing demonstrated a homozygous pathogenic variant in the POLG-1 gene (A467T).,1
"Early in the course following transplantation the patient experienced several focal aware-motor seizures that involved the left upper and lower extremity and were successfully managed with a combination of levetiracetam, lacosamide, pregabalin and topiramate. As of October 2019, he continues to have preserved allograft function with normal liver enzyme tests while receiving tacrolimus, prednisone, Lcarnitine and Co-enzyme Q-10. Discussion",1
"Patients with mutations in the POLG-1 gene encoding mitochondrial DNA polymerase often are afﬂicted with drug-resistant seizures and progressive neurological dysfunction at a young age [8,9]. Both heterozygotes and homozygotes with point mutations in the POLG-1 gene are at increased risk of developing injury to the liver when given VPA especially in patients given the drug that tends to develop within the ﬁrst 3 months of treatment and in those receiving multiple antiseizure drugs [2]. VPA may inhibit mitochondrial beta-oxidation through the microsomal production of toxic metabolites or via direct effects on mitochondrial function [10,11]. The estimated prevalence of nuclear and mitochondrial disorders in the adult general population is 7 per 100,000. Prior case series report a 1-year survival rate as low as 18% in children transplanted for VPA-induced ALF who have a known mitochondrial disorder [12]. As a result, many experts advise against proceeding with liver transplantation in children with VPA-related ALF who have known POLG1 mutations [13,14]. Our patient's POLG-1 mutation, A467T is the most common mutation for POLG-1-related disorders and the A467T and W748S mutations account for nearly 2/3 of patients with autosomal recessive POLG-related disorders [8]. These POLG-1",0

"that prompt administration of L-carnitine which is frequently depleted in patients on chronic VPA therapy may rescue some patients with severe acute VPA-induced liver injury [15,16]. Unfortunately, L-carnitine was not instituted prior to transplant in our patient due to the difﬁculty in establishing a diagnosis of idiosyncratic drug-induced hepatic injury due to VPA.",0
"Due to its side-effect proﬁle, VPA is often used as a second line antiseizure drug for adults and children with focal epilepsies. Nonetheless, it is reported by ClinCalc.com that in 2016 there were 5,484,270 total prescriptions of divalproex sodium identiﬁed in the United States. The incidence of mitochondrial diseases in the United Kingdom population is 1 in 4000 to 1 in 5000 [17]. Some authors have advocated for testing for POLG mutations in all children under the age of 2 prior to initiating VPA therapy although this is not routinely done in most medical centers in the United States [18]. Furthermore, the overall incidence of severe idiosyncratic drug-induced hepatic injury from VPA decreases with age and among adults the overall incidence is estimated at 1 in 40,000 [3,4]. However, a notable exception would be an adult patient presenting with focal status epilepticus without other explanation since this could be the ﬁrst clinical manifestation of a subclinical congenital mitochondrial disorder as was seen in this case [18]. In those instances, whole exome sequencing to identify the entire POLG gene would be helpful in patients independent of their ethnicity. Epilepsy patients that harbor an unrecognized POLG-1 mutation may be at increased risk for severe VPA hepatotoxicity [19,20].",0
"In the past, acute liver failure attributed to VPA therapy in patients with known POLG1 mutations has been considered a contraindication to liver transplantation among children [12–14]. However, the current case illustrates that liver transplantation can result in favorable clinical outcomes among adult patients with presumably milder forms of mitochondrial disorders. It is possible that our patient's older age at presentation and lack of features suggestive of Alpers–Huttenlocher syndrome may have contributed to his more favorable outcome [9].

"To determine the pathogenicity of a novel POLG mutation in a man with late-onset autosomal recessive progressive external ophthalmoplegia using clinical, molecular, and biochemical analyses. Methods A multipronged approach with detailed neurologic examinations, muscle biopsy analyses, molecular genetic studies, and in vitro biochemical characterization. Results",0
"The patient had slowly progressive bilateral ptosis and severely reduced horizontal and vertical gaze. Muscle biopsy showed slight variability in muscle ﬁber size, scattered ragged red ﬁbers, and partial cytochrome c oxidase deﬁciency. Biallelic mutations were identiﬁed in the POLG gene encoding the catalytic A subunit of POLγ. One allele carried a novel mutation in the exonuclease domain (c.590T>C; p.F197S), and the other had a previously characterized null mutation in the polymerase domain (c.2740A>C; p.T914P). Biochemical characterization revealed that the novel F197S mutant protein had reduced exonuclease and DNA polymerase activities and conﬁrmed that T914P was inactive. By deep sequencing of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) extracted from muscle, multiple large-scale rearrangements were mapped and quantiﬁed.",1
"Conclusions The patient’s phenotype was caused by biallelic POLG mutations, resulting in one inactive POLγA protein (T914P) and one with decreased polymerase and exonuclease activity (F197S). The reduction in polymerase activity explains the presence of multiple pathogenic large-scale deletions in the patient’s mtDNA.

At age 55 years, he noted slowly progressive bilateral ptosis and also a limitation in both horizontal and vertical gaze. Since age 65 years, he has complete horizontal ophthalmoplegia, no upward gaze whatsoever, but has limited downward gaze. He has been bilaterally operated for ptosis. A complete clinical neurologic examination was otherwise normal except a slight bilateral sensory-neuronal hearing impairment thought to be a cochlear aﬄiction due to his mitochondrial disorder.

In the 3959 exonuclease domain, the F197 residue is located within a large hydrophobic pocket where it forms numerous van der Waals interactions with the surrounding residues (ﬁgure 2B, upper panel). Substitution of the bulky and hydrophobic phenylalanine with the smaller and polar serine would likely cause partial collapse of this pocket and local structural distortions. This may induce a misalignment of the neighboring D198 residue and subsequent reduction in its ability to bind a catalytically essential Mg2+ ion. Of interest, the closely related T7 DNA polymerase carries a serine at this position (ﬁgure 2C, lower panel) arguing that this amino acid change might not provoke structural or functional changes. Structural analysis, however, revealed that the exonuclease pocket is substantially smaller and that the presence of a phenylalanine would induce severe steric clashes and likely destabilize the exonuclease domain in T7 DNA polymerase (ﬁgure 2C, upper panel).",0
"Despite being tolerated in T7 DNA polymerase, we decided to test whether the serine aﬀects the 39-59 exonuclease activity of POLγA in vitro. A double-stranded template with a one-nt 39-ﬂap (ﬁgure 2D, lower panel) was incubated with the WT or mutant POLγ variants including a previously characterized exonuclease-deﬁcient mutant D274A (herein EXO-) for comparison.11 As expected, WT POLγ was able to hydrolyze the primer (ﬁgure 2D, lanes 1–5), whereas EXOwas unable to degrade the primer (ﬁgure 2D, lanes 6–10). F197S was able to degrade the primer, however, to a much lower extent than WT. This demonstrates that in POLγA, unlike the related T7 DNA polymerases, a serine at this position is not well",0
"tolerated (ﬁgure 2D, lanes 16-20). No 39-59 exonuclease activity from T914P was observed (ﬁgure 2D, lanes 11–15), likely due to the lack of DNA binding rather than an enzymatic eﬀect of the mutation.7",0
"The exonuclease-deﬁcient POLγ (EXO-) in mice causes a 5-fold increase in mtDNA point mutations,12 prompting us to investigate the mutation load of the patient’s mtDNA. We isolated total muscle DNA from the patient and performed deep DNA sequencing. We identiﬁed a slight, but signiﬁcant, increase in mtDNA point mutations in the patient compared with age-matched controls (table), consistent with our in vitro ﬁndings. However, the level of heteroplasmy is likely too low to by itself explain the disease phenotype in the patient. The F197S mutation affects DNA polymerase activity",0
"We next tested the polymerase activities of the mutants. First, we performed a DNA synthesis assay using a circular singlestranded DNA (ssDNA) template (ﬁgure 3A, lower panel). Because the F197S mutation is located in the 39-59 exonuclease domain, we also included EXOfor comparison. We found that F197S was active as a polymerase, albeit with strongly diminished activity compared with WT and EXO- (ﬁgure 3A, lanes 16–20 vs 1–5 and 6–10, respectively). The speed of replication was slower, generating less full-length product due to increased stalling. T914P was unable to support DNA synthesis (ﬁgure 3A, lanes 11–15).7",0
"We also examined DNA synthesis in the context of the replisome (i.e., in the presence of the TWINKLE helicase and Figure 2 The F197S point mutation reduces 39-59 exonuclease activity",0
(A) The F197S mutant has WT-like DNA binding affinity. DNA affinity of POLγ to a primer template (lowerpanel) was examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Each reaction contained 10 fmol of DNA template and increasing (indicated) amounts of POLγ holoenzyme in a final volume of 15 μL. The reactions were run on 6% native polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 × TBE for 30 minutes at 180 V and visualized by autoradiography. No major differences in binding affinity between WT and F197S were observed. (B) The F197S point mutation disrupts the architecture of the exonuclease pocket. F197 is located in a large hydrophobic pocket directly adjacent to the catalytically essential D198 (upper panel; PDB ID: 3IKM). This residue is strongly conserved among members of the DNA polymerase A family (lower panel; Sc = Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Dm = Drosophila melanogaster; Xl = Xenopus laevis; Hs = Homo sapiens; Mm,0
"= Mus musculus). (C) The T7 exonuclease pocket is substantially smaller to accommodate a serine residue at the position equivalent to F197. Mutation of this residue to phenylalanine results in steric clashes, which would likely destabilize the pocket (PDB ID: 1T7P; Hs = Homo sapiens; T7 = bacteriophage T7). (D) A 59-labeled (32P) primer with a 39-mismatch was annealed to a circular single-stranded plasmid (lower panel to the left). POLγA with 39-59 exonuclease activity will, in the absence of dNTP, hydrolyze DNA into shorter fragments. As expected, WT degraded the primer (lanes 1–5), whereas EXOcould not due to lack of exonuclease activity (lanes 6–10). T914P showed no activity. The F197S mutant had weak exonuclease activity, only able to hydrolyze a few nucleotides under these conditions. The arrow indicates the partially hydrolyzed primer.",0

Here, F197S was able to synthesize long stretches of DNA, although it was not as eﬃcient as WT (ﬁgure 3B, compare lanes 11–15 and 1–5). T914P was not able to support DNA synthesis (ﬁgure 3A, lanes 11–15 and 3B lanes 6–10).7 To mimic the in vivo situation Table Somatic point mutations detected in mtDNA in the range between 1% and 5% heteroplasmy levels Heteroplasmy levels (%) Abbreviation: mtDNA = mitochondrial DNA. a Found in 1 of 10 controls.",0
"(of the patient), a reaction was included where both diseaseassociated mutants were mixed at a 1:1 ratio, but keeping the same total amount of protein. This decreased the eﬃciency of replication further due to only half the amount of POLγA (F197S) being functional (ﬁgure 3B, lanes 16–20 vs 11–15). The F197S mutant causes multiple deletions and duplications in vivo",0
"Disease-causing mutations in POLγ are known to cause mtDNA depletion and/or multiple mtDNA rearrangements. Based on the deep sequencing of isolated total muscle DNA, we found that mtDNA copy number in the patient was comparable to two controls, demonstrating that the patient does not exhibit mtDNA depletion (ﬁgure 4, A and C). However, the patient did have multiple deletions in both the major and minor arc (ﬁgure 4B). The sum heteroplasmy for the deletions and duplications amounted to 50.7%, which likely explains the patient’s phenotype (ﬁgure 4D). Of interest, we also found a strong hotspot region for duplications spanning over the promoter region (position 300 nt–1,000 nt) where the top 3 candidate duplications were closely spaced (positions: 310–962, 310–960, and 315–965) (ﬁgure",0

Discussion We describe a patient with myopathy, PEO, and ptosis associated with biallelic POLG mutations. By identiﬁcation of mitochondrial myopathy caused by multiple large-scale mtDNA rearrangements and in vitro functional analysis of the identiﬁed POLG variants, we can explain several of the diﬀerent molecular events leading to the disease and thus functionally link the primary genetic defect to the clinical phenotype.",1
"POLG mutations are the most common cause of mitochondrial disease and are associated with a large variety of clinical phenotypes ranging from severe infantile neurodegenerative disorder with liver disease to late onset PEO with minor or no other symptoms.13 Our patient had a mild phenotype with ptosis and ophthalmoplegia as his main symptoms, requiring surgery for ptosis several years before his genetic diagnosis. His hearing deﬁcit was probably due to the POLG-associated mitochondrial disease because hearing loss is a characteristic ﬁnding in patients with PEO, especially autosomal dominant PEO. Whether the brain atrophy was part of the syndrome has not been deﬁnitely established, but brain atrophy has been found in 28% of patients with POLG-associated epilepsy.14",1
"Why some patients with mitochondrial disease develop PEO is not completely clear, partly because extraocular muscles are relatively inaccessible. However, MRI studies have demonstrated that extraocular muscles are atrophic in patients with PEO.15,16 The reason for this vulnerability has been speculated to depend on the distinct physiologic characteristics of extraocular muscles.17 They are very rich in mitochondria and are highly dependent on oxidative phosphorylation for endurance despite their composition of mainly fast-twitch ﬁbers, and they develop age-related mitochondrial changes with multiple deletions at a considerably higher rate than limb muscles. It is therefore likely that they accumulate multiple deletions secondary to POLγA dysfunction at a higher rate than limb muscles, which then leads to atrophy and muscle ﬁber loss.",0
"Our biochemical analysis of the mutant proteins showed that T914P had no activities, consistent with its previous characterization as an aggregation-prone inactive protein.7 The only potentially functional polymerase in the patient is thus Figure 3 The F197S mutation affects DNA polymerase activity",0

We found that F197S has reduced exonuclease and polymerase activities compared with WT POLγA, which can explain the patient phenotype.

"point mutations.18 F197S is uniquely located in motif I, adjacent to the D198 residue that is essential for 39-59 exonuclease activity.19 As expected from the location and strong conservation, F197S showed severely reduced 39-59 exonuclease activity. Nonetheless, this appears to be suﬃcient to deal with nucleotide misincorporation because only a very modest increase in mtDNA point mutations was observed in the patient.",0
We instead propose that the pathogenic molecular defect lies in reduced polymerase activity. That a mutation in the exonuclease domain can aﬀect polymerase activity is unexpected,0
"but not unprecedented20,21 and may be due to an imbalance between the polymerase and exonuclease activities. The ineﬃcient polymerase activity explains the patient’s disease phenotype and presence of mtDNA rearrangements. Recently, we were able to reconstitute mtDNA deletion formation in vitro and could demonstrate that replication stalling during L-strand synthesis causes copy-choice recombination and deletion formation.9 Most reported deletions in patients are found in the major arc of mtDNA, a ;11-kb region that becomes single-stranded during H-strand replication and acts as an ssDNA template during L-strand synthesis. The strong replication stalling by F197S on ssDNA can explain the mtDNA deletions identiﬁed in the patient.",0
"We also found mtDNA breakpoints consistent with duplications over the promoter region (mtDNA position 300–1,000 nt). Whether duplications themselves are pathogenic is not clear because no genetic material is lost. Exactly how these duplications arise is not known, but it would be interesting to investigate whether the G-rich conserved sequence block region causes extra problems for polymerases to bypass. It is intriguing to speculate that replication stalling, in combination with the high transcription activity in this area (both light and heavy strand promoters are located here), causes the duplications. In future, we will try to identify speciﬁc sequences that are hotspots for polymerase stalling to elucidate the formation of duplications/deletions further.",0
"More than 300 pathogenic POLG mutations have been reported, but the pathogenicity can be diﬃcult to establish. Here, we applied in vitro assays to investigate the functional properties of speciﬁc POLγ mutants, which in combination with clinical investigation and detailed analysis of mtDNA rearrangements by means of genome sequencing demonstrated not only pathogenicity but also deepens our understanding of the pathobiology. This approach will be essential in the future to evaluate novel POLG variants and already described variants that are not fully characterized with regard to pathogenicity.",0

"Introduction POLG (POLG1) is a nuclear gene that codes for the catalytic subunit of polymerase c, an enzyme with both polymerase and exonuclease functions, allowing for the proofreading of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) [1]. Damaging mutations in POLG could lead to defective polymerase or exonuclease activity of the enzyme, thereby causing mtDNA mutations. Point mutations in mtDNA arise from defective polymerase activity of the POLG enzyme, whereas defective exonuclease activity results in an accumulation of both point mutations and deletions in the mtDNA [1–6].",0
"Mutations in POLG are known to cause a range of autosomal dominant (AD) and autosomal recessive (AR) disorders with overlapping clinical features including seizure, developmental delay, migraines, stroke-like episodes, extrapyramidal movement disorders, peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, depression, anxiety, sensorineural hearing loss, retinopathy, cataracts, gastrointestinal dysmotility, liver failure, myopathy, hypotonia, diabetes mellitus, primary ovarian/ testicular failure and cardiomyopathies [2, 6–10]. Despite the overlapping features, there are distinct clinical phenotypes described due to POLG mutations which include childhood myocerebrohepatopathy spectrum (CMS; AR), myoclonic epilepsy myopathy sensory ataxia (MEMSA; AR), sensory ataxic neuropathy, dysarthria and ophthalmoparesis [SANDO; AR; also known as ataxia neuropathy spectrum (ANS)], autosomal recessive and dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) and the most severe form Alpers–Huttenlocher syndrome (AHS; AR) [6, 7].",0
"CMS is characterized by infantile onset of its cardinal features which include hypotonia, developmental delay, hepatopathy and GI involvement [6]. The classical tetrad of MEMSA includes seizures, myopathy, neuropathy and ataxia in the absence of ophthalmoplegia [7]. The characteristic features associated with SANDO (ANS) are ataxia and neuropathy with many developing seizures and ophthalmoplegia [7]. AD PEO is characterized by migraines, ophthalmoplegia and CNS involvement, while the AR PEO is associated with ophthalmoplegia, weakness and the potential for cardiac and gastrointestinal symptoms [6, 11–13]. Hallmark features of AHS include developmental delay, hepatopathy, seizures and GI involvement [6, 14–16]. A number of overlapping ocular features have been associated with these clinical entities, including external ophthalmoplegia, pigmentary retinopathy, cataracts and eyelid ptosis [9, 17, 18]. Regardless of etiology, acquired or inherited, many generalized retinal disorders require a full-field electroretinogram (ERG) for an accurate diagnosis and prognosis [19]. While some conditions may have hallmark signs visible on fundus examination, some",0
"disorders have normal retinal appearance and are better assessed and diagnosed with an ERG [19]. In cases with generalized trans-synaptic or bipolar cell deficits, an electronegative configuration to darkadapted (DA) bright flash (DA 3.0 and DA 10.0) ERGs is seen, as the b-wave amplitude is smaller than the a-wave amplitude [19]. An electronegative ERG is characteristic of retinal disorders such as congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB), X-linked retinoschisis and juvenile Batten disease [19].",0
"POLG is ubiquitously expressed, and in the retina, it is expressed in the inner and outer plexiform layers as well as the ganglion cells [1]. Neuron-specific mice models of POLG with impaired exonuclease activity showed a reduced b:a ratio of the scotopic ERG suggesting retinal rod ON-bipolar dysfunction [1]. A normal ERG is one of the minor diagnostic criteria for AHS [20]; however, there are only a few cases in the literature that have reported on ERG findings [21]. This is a case report of a boy with biallelic POLG mutations, demonstrating the first documented occurrence of an electronegative ERG in addition to typical systemic features of a POLG-related disorder.",0
"Case report The study was approved by the Research Ethics Board at the Hospital for Sick Children Toronto, and informed consent was obtained from the parent; the study protocols adhered to the tenets of the Declara-tion of Helsinki. Systemic features",1
"The proband is of Indian descent, and there was no known history of hereditary illnesses. After an uneventful pregnancy, the proband was born at term via spontaneous vaginal delivery. Growth parameters for height and weight were in the third percentile. Upon weaning at 6 months and introduction of solid foods, the child was noted to have a decreased appetite with episodes of cyclical vomiting. The child began to walk at 9 months and speak sentences after 2 years. The child displayed no signs of dysarthria or receptive/expressive language deficits and there was no regression of language skills. After a series of afebrile seizures, at 2 years, the child was started on anticonvulsant therapy (oxcarbazepine). Following two",1
"seizure-free years, oxcarbazepine was discontinued and there were no recurrences. At the age of four, the child developed worsening anorexia and a mild limitation of gross motor activities. Coenzyme Q10, creatine, alpha lipoic acid and carnitine were sequentially added from the age of 9 years in an attempt to slow the dystrophic pattern. At 11 years of age, weakness of his respiratory muscles was noted resulting in mild obstructive sleep apnea, a chronic cough and the requirement of a cough assistance device.",1
"By the age of twelve, the child had to be fed through a G-tube due to the dysphagia, was wheelchair bound and needed assistance with all aspects of self-care. At 13, the child was hospitalized for aspiration pneumonia that required extensive use of the cough assistance device and salivary Botox to control his secretions. The child also developed bilateral hand contractures, and at his most recent visit, at 14, he is failing to thrive, and palliative care is likely the only treatment option. Ocular features",1
"At the age of five, the child had symptoms of photophobia and on evaluation, bilateral ptosis was noted alongside a difficulty with extraocular eye movements. At 9 years, the palpebral fissure was 4 mm on the right and 7 mm on the left, requiring extension of the neck to maintain eye contact. Extraocular movements showed elevation (- 3), abduction (- 1) and adduction (- 1) deficits in either eye. The child’s uncorrected and corrected visual acuity was 0.50 and 0.40 LogMAR in the right and left eyes, respectively. The cycloplegic refraction was ?",1
"3.00 and ? 1.50/- 3.00 9 180° in the right and left eyes, respectively. Fundus evaluation was normal, and the spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT; Bioptigen, Inc) showed normal central retinal thickness and layering (Fig. 1). Full-field ERG was performed on Espion (Diagnosys LCC, Lowell, MA) system using ERG-Jet contact lens electrodes. Due to patient fatigue (myopathy) and other health considerations, the ERG was performed monocularly over two sessions; the right eye scotopic and photopic ERGs were performed at 10 and 13 years, respectively, and the left eye ERG was performed at 13 years. Hence, some steps of the scotopic ERG were in compliance with an earlier ISCEV standard, whereas the remainder of the steps were in compliance",1
"with latest ISCEV standards [22, 23]. The darkadapted (DA) dim-light ERG (DA 0.01) showed low normal b-wave amplitude; DA 2.29 and DA 7.6 ERG’s showed normal a-wave amplitudes and reduced b/a ratio. The DA 7.6 ERGs showed an electronegative configuration. The light-adapted ERGs (LA 3.0 30 Hz and LA 3.0 2 Hz) were within normal limits; cone ON–OFF ERGs performed using white stimulus (166.66 cd m-2) on white background (30 cd m-2) and an amber stimulus on a green background [19] were normal (Fig. 2). Genetic results",0
"At the age of ten, a previously reported homozygous missense mutation was identified in POLG (c.911T [ G/p.Leu304Arg). The child was also screened for CSNB using a next-generation sequencing panel containing 18 known genes; no pathogenic variants or copy number variations were identified. Discussion",1
"This is the first documented case of an electronegative ERG, suggestive of generalized rod ON-bipolar dysfunction, in a POLG-related disorder. The proband presented with well-documented systemic and ocular features associated with POLG-related disorders including seizures, headaches, areflexia, hypotonia, myopathy, vomiting, ophthalmoplegia and ptosis; his clinical phenotype was most consistent with SANDO (Table 1). Typically, SANDO presents later in life with ataxia as the principal feature (average age: 32.9 years; range 5–73 years) followed by PEO within a decade; dysarthria and seizures are relatively uncommon [24]. Although the proband shared six clinical features with AHS, the presence of myopathy and lack of liver involvement suggest his phenotype to be SANDO [7], acknowledging that the severity and earlier presentation of symptoms in the proband place him along a continuum of clinical presentations seen in SANDO. The phenotypic descriptions of various POLG-related disorders, with their hallmark signs and symptoms, and inheritance patterns are summarized in Table 1.",1
"With the wide variability of onset and severity in POLG-related disorders, it can be difficult to predict and compare phenotypes. For example, seizure is a Fig. 1 Fundus and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) from the proband. A and B show normal fundus photographs from the right and left eyes, respectively. C and D show horizon line scan of the SD-OCT through the fovea that demonstrates normal central retinal layering in either eye",0
"Fig. 2 Full-field ERG results from the proband (A right eye and B left eye).

"fairly common and overlapping feature in most POLG-related disorders (Table 1). The literature often describes treatment-resistant seizures as a symptom that develops later in the disease progression [25–29]; however, Tzoulis et al. reported epilepsy as the presenting complaint in half of their POLG cohort [30]. In SANDO, the prevalence of seizure was observed in 29% of cases at presentation [24]. In the present report, the proband developed seizures at the age of two, rather early in the course of the disease, and is on remission following treatment. The proband also reported sporadic headaches, beginning at the age",1
"of four, while Tzoulis et al. documented headaches as the presenting complaint in over 25% of cases [30]. Specifically in ANS, headaches have been documented to precede other symptoms by many years [7]. From the age of four, the proband had hypotonia in all four extremities, and the examiner’s reports indicated difficulty eliciting tendon reflexes throughout the child’s life. Patients with AHS and CMS also have reported hypotonia and areflexia, often presenting in the first 2 or 3 years of life, while these symptoms have yet to be reported in SANDO or ANS [7, 31]. The proband suffered from early vomiting, which has been",1
"similarly described in patients with AHS and CMS; dysphagia is noted on presentation in 24% of molecularly confirmed cases of SANDO/ANS [24, 25, 31]. Myopathy is a fairly ubiquitous symptom of POLGrelated disorders, having its onset described anywhere from 3 to 60 years of age, with variability in its severity and pace of progression [25]. Within SANDO/ANS, roughly 25% of cases have documented cramps, but a recent report estimated that 52% of cases with POLG-related SANDO had limb girdle paresis [7, 24, 25]. The proband had symptoms of severe progressive myopathy documented as early as the age of four. Ocular myopathic signs such as ptosis and external ophthalmoplegia are common in most POLG-related disorders with the age of onset ranging from 10 years of age to adulthood; these symptoms were first noted in the proband at the age of 5 years [11–13, 32]. Ophthalmoplegia has been documented in up to half of SANDO/ANS patients; however, some report extraocular muscle involvement as both a later and a milder symptom, relative to the sensory ataxic neuropathy [7, 73]. Hanisch et al. reported that among molecularly confirmed SANDO, ataxia was the commonest disabling symptom at presentation (67%) [24]. The absence of frank ataxia even at the time of the most recent examination was due to the proband’s",1
limited capacity for movement.,0
"While the proband displays many similarities to other known POLG phenotypes, his ocular phenotype is distinct in the fact that he had an electronegative ERG, under dark-adapted conditions, consistent with rod ON-bipolar cell dysfunction. The cone ON and OFF bipolar functions were normal. In the literature, patients with POLG mutations-related AHS are often described as having normal ERGs [20, 21]; the relative paucity of reported ERG abnormalities in the literature may be in part due to infrequent testing in this patient population. Polg has been shown to be well expressed in the mice inner retina, and mutant mice with defective exonuclease activity have features of retinal ON-bipolar dysfunction on ERG testing [1]. The sparing of cone ON and OFF systems in the proband is striking as most inherited conditions with selective inner retinal dysfunction affect both rod and cone bipolar systems, with the exception of Duchenne/ Becker muscular dystrophy, the findings of which are similar to what is noted in the proband [19, 33]. Fundus examination was normal in the proband; however, reported findings in POLG-related disorders",0
"range from normal retinal examination to pigmentary retinopathy [9, 11]. It is notable that the proband had symptoms of photophobia, the cause for which is unknown.",1
"POLG-related disorders are genetically heterogeneous, and there are over 100 mutations associated with AHS, over 80 mutations associated with PEO and over 25 mutations associated with SANDO-related syndromes [34]. The p.Leu304Arg variant found in the proband has been reported in the literature in both homozygous and compound heterozygous state numerous times. The p.Leu304Arg variant in homozygous state has almost always been associated with SANDO/ANS disease spectrum in the literature, with an age of onset between 2 and 23 years of age [35–38]. The p.Leu304Arg variant in compound heterozygous state with other variants led to a range of phenotypic presentations [36]. For instance, Van Goethem et al. described a sibship with compound heterozygous mutations (p.Leu304Arg/Ala467Thr) whose symptoms of PEO and skeletal muscle weakness (red ragged fibers on muscle biopsy) had a mean age of onset of 25 ± 7 years, with no retinal or hepatic involvement [11], whereas Stewart et al. described a patient with the same variants (p.Leu304Arg/ Ala467Thr) who had seizures, peripheral neuropathy and hepatopathy consistent with AHS [39]. Further, both missense and frameshifting variants in trans with the p.Leu304Arg variant have been associated with AHS [40, 41]. Other missense variants in combination with the p.Leu304Arg allele have been associated with SANDO and AR PEO, respectively [38, 42]. This is consistent with the existing literature wherein there is only limited genotype–phenotype associations with POLG variants (as seen in p.Leu304Arg homozygous cases) [34, 43].",0
"Conclusion This is a case of a young boy, who carried homozygous POLG mutations and demonstrated a series of symptoms associated with a broad category of POLG syndromes including seizures, headaches, areflexia/ hypotonia, myopathy, vomiting, ophthalmoplegia and ptosis. His features were most consistent with SANDO; however, the proband also demonstrated selective rod ON-bipolar cell dysfunction, a feature never previously reported in human POLG-related disorders. However, the role of POLG in retinal signaling is unknown and needs to be further studied.",1

"Sensory ataxic neuropathy with dysarthria and ophthalmoparesis (SANDO) is an adult onset sensory ataxic neuropathy, dysarthria and chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia associated with mutations in POLG1. We report a 38-year-old woman with a history of progressive gait instability and bilateral ptosis. Neurological examination found ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and dysarthria. MRI showed bilateral thalamic and cerebellar lesions. A POLG related disorder was suspected and after DNA sequencing a SANDO with a novel mutation in POLG was confirmed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

"In patients with mitochondrial diseases, the most frequent clinical symptom is chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO), the latter is often associated with multisystem presentations, so the term CPEO-plus has been employed to include all patients within the spectrum. Sensory ataxic neuropathy with dysarthria and ophthalmoparesis (SANDO) is one of the most common chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia-plus (CPEO-plus) syndromes [1,2]. The POLG gene, which is located in chromosome 15q25.7 encodes the polymerase gamma enzyme that participates in the replication and repair of mitochondrial DNA. Certain mutations in this gene give rise to the so-called ""POLGrelated disorders"", which include CPEO itself, epilepsy, parkinsonism, infertility in men, Alpers syndrome and ataxianeuropathy spectrum (SANO, SANDO and MIRAS)[1–3].",0

"We present a 38-year-old woman, with no relevant prior clinical history or consanguinity in family members. Her condition began at age 27, with progressive gait instability that slowly worsened and after 5 years of onset progressive bilateral ptosis was developed. She began the evaluation in our hospital 11 years after the onset of symptoms, at first evaluation we noted an ataxic gait and the presence of bilateral ptosis.",1
"Neurological examination revealed, normal mental state, pupils without abnormalities, bilateral complete ophthalmoplegia, dysarthria, normal strength with global areflexia, normal sensitive examination, wide-based gait and positive Romberg test. General laboratory studies were unremarkable. Targeted studies including rheumatoid factor, C-reactive protein levels, serologies for HIV and syphilis, vitamin B12 levels and J.D. Parada-Garza, G.

Post-contrast T1weighted MRI (C, D) does not show contrast enhancement. antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor were reported normal. Positive antinuclear antibodies in 1:1280 dilution with a centromeric fluorescence pattern were reported. The electrodiagnostic studies showed sensory axonal neuropathy and negative repetitive stimulation test.",1
"Brain MRI revealed T2 and FLAIR hyperintense bilateral lesions in the dorsomedial thalami and cerebellar white matter. Diffusion-weighted and contrast-enhanced MRI were normal (Fig. 1A-D). Based on these results the suspicion of a ""POLG related disorder"" increased. Molecular genetic investigation with DNA sequencing of the POLG1 gene discovered two heterozygote mutations c.264C> G and c.3287G> T, thus a SANDO variety of the ataxia-neuropathy spectrum was diagnosed. Discussion The clinical evolution with initial predominant ataxia and late CPEO (which invariably develops during the first decade",1
of the disease) of our case is consistent with previous reports in SANDO case series [1].,0
"According to prior reports, in cases of ataxia-neuropathy spectrum, the MRI findings such as the hyperintense lesions in cerebellar white matter, inferior olivary nucleus and dorsomedial thalami have been the pivot signs for the initial diagnosis and an indication to proceed with a sequencing of POLG gene, just as happened in this case [2]. The most common MRI findings in these patients are the with matter lesions in 26%, cerebellar lesions in 19% and thalamic lesions in 15% of cases [1]. Therefore, knowledge of this signs in the ataxia-neuropathy spectrum related to POLG mutation is useful to facilitate the diagnosis.",0
"The sequence variant c.264C>G p.Phe88Leu replaces phenylalanine with leucine at codon 88 of the POLG protein. The phenylalanine residue is highly conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between phenylalanine and leucine. This variant has been observed in individuals with POLG related disease and is classified as a variant of uncertain significance [4,5]. c.3287G>T is the second 592 J.D. Parada-Garza, G.

"sequence variant presented by our patient, it is predicted that it will result in amino acids substitution p.Arg1096Leu in the exon 21 of the POLG gene. The R1096L mutation is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. Previously, a different amino acid change was reported in this position (p.Arg1096Cys by 3286C>T) as pathogenic in a patient with a ""POLG-related disorder"" diagnosis with CPEO [4]. Therefore, the clinical significance of p.Arg1096Leu interprets as likely pathogenic[6,7,8].",1
"The most frequent POLG mutations that are reports to cause of SANDO include A467T, T748S, R627W, H932Y and G1051R [9]. However, the same mutation can give rise to different clinical pictures and vice versa, so this are genetically heterogenous diseases. Conclusion",0
"In this case report, the MRI findings were essential for the diagnostic approach, and a further sequencing of the POLG gene. The ever-expanding molecular and clinical spectrum of mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma mutations, now enriches with the c.3287G>T mutation with a clinical spectrum consisting with ophthalmoplegia, ataxia and sensory neuronopathy.

"A 25-year-old Moroccan man experienced his first symptoms when he was 7 years old with progressive bilateral ptosis. His parents were consanguineous (first degree). His gait had become progressively unsteady with falls and painful paresthesia. His speech was progressively becoming more slurred suggesting a probably associated cerebellar syndrome. Ophthalmologic examination revealed bilateral ptosis (Fig. 1a) with severe ophthalmoparesis in all directions. Gait showed a marked sensory ataxia with a positive Romberg sign. Speech was dysarthric. Motor examination revealed atrophy involving mainly the distal muscles with pes cavus (Fig. 1b and d) and severe proprioceptive impairment. Pectus excavatum (funnel breast) (Fig. 1c) and cleft palate were also present. Electroneuromyography revealed severe axonal predominantly sensory peripheral neuropathy. Skeletal muscle biopsy revealed ragged red fibers (Fig. 1e). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was normal. The laboratory investigations revealed elevation in serum lactate 886 mg/l (normal: 57–220) and pyruvate 21.66 mg/L (normal: 3.60– 5.90). Molecular genetic analysis revealed multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions in muscle tissue detected by the long-range PCR technique. Sequencing of the POLG1 gene revealed the c. 1789C > T (p.Arg597Trp) mutation in the homozygous state. The c. 1789C > T mutation was found in heterozygous form in his consanguineous parents with no manifestation of disease. Based on ACMG guidelines and in silico gene variant tolerance analysis, c.1789C > T (p.Arg597Trp) variant is classified in the ClinVar database as pathogenic/likely pathogenic by three submitters (GeneDx; EGL Genetic Diagnostics [Eurofins Clinical Diagnostics] and Wong Mito Lab [Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine]). Also, this substitution is located in the linker domain (residues 418–755) which is a highly conserved region. Using four computational methods, a functional impact combined score of 2.65 was obtained by Mutation Assessor classifying the change as ‘‘medium’’. Otherwise, SIFT Polyphen-2 and SNPs&GO software predicted the variant to be deleterious, probably damaging and disease related, respectively.",1

"The first cases of SANDO were reported in 1997 [1] to describe a novel mitochondrial disease associated with multiple mtDNA mutations in four unrelated patients who presented with sensory ataxic neuropathy, dysarthria and ophthalmoplegia [1]. Since then few cases have been reported. We present the first case of a Moroccan patient with different clinical features of ‘‘SMANDO’’ syndrome (Sensory Motor Ataxic Neuropathy ‘‘CMT like’’ Phenotype associated dysarthria and Ophthalmoplegia) due to a new POLG gene homozygote mutation that illustrates the phenotypic variability and difficult diagnosis of this syndrome. The pathophysiology of SANDO most often results from mutations in the POLG1 gene [2]. POLG1 usually encodes for DNA polymerase-g which is important in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication. There are now over 150 POLG1 mutations known and collectively these mutations result in errors in mtDNA [2,3]. These errors accumulate and cause dysfunction in the respiratory chain of the oxidative-phosphorylation pathway leading to clinical symptoms and findings. SANDO can be either an autosomal recessive or de novo mutation, rarely reported as autosomal dominant. There is a wide phenotypical variation making diagnosis difficult, as was the case in our patient who had a typical manifestation of SANDO, with an important atrophy involving mainly the distal muscles.",0
There is considerable variability in the phenotype of,0
"mitochondrial disease making the diagnosis between different syndromes difficult [4,5]. Mutations in the POLG gene have emerged and they are responsible for a heterogeneous group of multiple syndromes (Alpers syndrome, Ataxia Neuropathy Spectrum disorders, Myoclonus Epilepsy Myopathy Sensory Ataxia, autosomal recessive Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia and autosomal dominant Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia) [6]. There has been no clear correlation between genotype and phenotype in patients with POLG mutations. The p.A467 T mutation in the linker region is the most common mutation.

"A 30-year-old man presented with acute-onset hand-and-foot dysesthesia and accommodative dysfunction. He had a nondisseminated testicular seminoma, treated by orchidectomy six months earlier. PET-scan follow-up disclosed a lymph node metastasis two weeks before symptom onset. He had no other medical history, nor did his family, specially no cases of neoplasia or neuropathy. The initial evaluation highlighted manifestations of peripheral dysautonomia: accommodative",0
"insufficiency, bilateral mydriasis (Fig. 1 Adie pupil; positive pilocarpine test at 1% and 0.1% dilutions), gastroparesis causing 10 kg weight loss, sympathicotonic orthostatic hypotension, erectile dysfunction and dysuria. He felt continuous local heat with electric discharges and burning sensations elicited by heat sources (showers) and walking. Deep tendon reflexes disappeared in two weeks. Cerebrospinal magnetic resonance imaging, lumbar puncture (including oligoclonal bands and onconeuronal antibodies), ENMG (including sudomotor reflexes) and immunological screening (including anti-Ma2, antiFGFR3 and anti-a3AChR, but not anti-Kelch-11 antibodies) were negative. The patient underwent exclusive radiotherapy during one month. Meanwhile and during the following two months, the neuropathic pain in the feet worsened despite early treatment with corticosteroids and polyvalent intravenous immunoglobulins. Tramadol, gabapentin, amitriptyline, capsaicin patches, morphine and ketamine could hardly control it. Only cold-water baths, soon permanent, provided relief. A red swelling of the feet was noted before the patient got used to cold-water baths and before he subsequently developed skin ulcerations (Fig. 1 trench foot). ENMG follow-up revealed length-dependent sensorimotor axonal neuropathy: 26.1 to",0
10.6 mV sensory ulnar nerve amplitude; 67.9 to 11.6 mV sensory,0
"sural nerve amplitude. The loss of sudomotor reflexes showed small-fiber impairment. Severe lymphopenia, reaching 100 cells/mm3, persisted after the intravenous corticosteroids. All clinical features progressively improved three months after onset with no persistent hypermetabolic mass on PET-scan. At ten months, bilateral mydriasis persisted as well as mild paresthesia in the feet and extension deficit of the right toes. All deep tendon reflexes reappeared and ENMG amplitudes were stable. After intensive rehabilitation, the patient achieved complete functional autonomy.",0
"This case illustrates an acute and severe symptomatology associating smalland large-fiber neuropathy and dysautonomia. The monophasic course matching the oncological history is highly evocative of a paraneoplastic syndrome. We found no known onconeuronal antibody. Testicular seminoma is rarely associated with paraneoplastic manifestations: limbic encephalitis, cerebellar ataxia, vertigo. Reported onconeuronal antibodies are anti-Yo, anti-Ma-2, anti-mGluR1 and anti-Kelch-11. To our knowledge, there is only one reported case of neuropathy associated with testicular seminoma [1]. Our case does not match the description of known paraneoplastic autonomic neuropathies like autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy [2], in which case a3AChR antibodies are found in 30% of patients [3]. Dysautonomia could have impaired vasoreactivity, yielding the hand-and-foot manifestations, evocative of a vascular acrosyndrome: erythromelalgia. Erythromelalgia spectrum associates paroxysmal extreme acral burning pain and swelling triggered by heat and relieved by cold, small-fiber neuropathy and, in 80% of cases, dysautonomia [4,5]. This matches the symptomatology of our case, except the non-paroxysmal symptomatology. In summary, this case evokes an extreme dysregulation of vasoreactivity resulting from an autonomic neuropathy.",0

After restart of the diet neither seizure control nor her baseline clinical state could be sustained anymore. At the age of 5.5 years, and 11 months after diagnosis, she died due to respiratory failure.2",0
"One year later (2010), Cardenas and Amato described a 14-month-old girl with compound heterozygous mutation in POLG1 gene (c.911T>G, c.1174C>g, pR1081dup) presenting with epilepsia partialis continua evolving into generalized status epilepticus. Treatment with a multidrug therapy, including ketogenic diet terminated her seizures, but she was severely encephalopathic. Several weeks after discharge seizures returned and she died at the age of 19 months, 5 months after diagnosis.3",0
"In 2011, Spiegler et al reported two patients diagnosed with Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome due to POLG1 mutation (patient 1 c.911T>G, c.3434insGAGG; patient 2 c.844T>G, c.1399G>A) at ages 33 and 45 months. Both were treated with ketogenic diet. The first patient did not respond and treatment was stopped 2 weeks after initiation, the boy died 3 months after diagnosis, at 35 months of age. The second patient became more alert and seizure activity ceased for a few weeks, but developed epilepsia partialis continua under treatment with antiepileptic drugs and KD, therapy was continued until death at 46 months.4 A 26-year-old woman with homozygous mutation in POLG1 gene (c.2243G>C) and non-convulsive status epilepticus was presented by Martikainen et al.5 Under low glycemic index treatment (LGIT), a variant of ketogenic diet, in addition to phenytoin, oxcarbazepine and levetiracetam, her symptoms resolved. Phenytoin and oxcarbazepine were gradually discontinued and she had no further seizures under levetiracetam monotherapy",0
"and LGIT.5 Another group described a boy diagnosed with Alpers syndrome and heterozygous POLG1 mutation (c.1399G>A; c.3562T>C) at the age of 9 months.6 After starting ketogenic diet at 13 months of age, seizures substantially decreased without clinical improvement. One month later and 5 months after diagnosis, he died due to congestive heart failure and respiratory difficulties.6 | DISCUSSION | Patients",0
"In our literature research, we found six patients with POLG mutation and intractable seizures receiving ketogenic diet2-5 (see Table 1). In five of these six patients, the diet led to substantial reduction of seizure activity, whereas general condition often did not improve.2-6 Four of these five died shortly after initiation of therapy2-4,6 (see Table 1). One reported patient did not respond, hence therapy was stopped after 2 weeks4 (see Table 1).",0
"In our patient, ketogenic diet only showed initial improvement of symptoms, with an improvement of EEG, finally leading to a reduction of antiseizure therapy and a stabilization of her general condition over a short time. However, she showed an outstanding rapid deterioration leading to death 3 months after initial presentation. | Ketogenic diet",0
"Ketogenic diet is used in inborn disorders of metabolism10,11 and is the treatment of choice in some of them; for example, glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome.12-14 Further, ketogenic diet was found to be effective for therapy of intractable seizures.11,15,16 However, the precise mechanism of action of the diet is not fully understood. As some inborn disorders of metabolism deteriorate with catabolism, ketosis should be reached and maintained without catabolism.",0
"According to data,1 most patients with POLG mutation presented with first symptoms in their early childhood. Our patient showed a juvenile and rapid progressive form of POLG mutation. The group of Martikainen presented a woman at the age of 26 years.5 Beside the adult patient, all patients died within 1 year after diagnosis. Thus, one might conclude that despite an initial improvement with ketogenic diet outcome is poor once symptoms have started. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS",0

"Mutations in the mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma catalytic subunit (POLγ A) compromise the stability of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) by leading to mutations, deletions and depletions in mtDNA. Patients with mutations in POLγ A often differ remarkably in disease severity and age of onset. In this work we have studied the functional consequence of POLγ A mutations in a patient with an uncommon and a very severe disease phenotype characterized by prenatal onset with intrauterine growth restriction, lactic acidosis from birth, encephalopathy, hepatopathy, myopathy, and early death. Muscle biopsy identified scattered COX-deficient muscle fibers, respiratory chain dysfunction and mtDNA depletion. We identified a novel POLγ A mutation (p.His1134Tyr) in trans with the previously identified p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu double mutant. Biochemical characterization of the purified recombinant POLγ A variants showed that the p.His1134Tyr mutation caused severe polymerase dysfunction. The p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu mutation caused reduced polymerase function in conditions of low dNTP concentration that mimic postmitotic tissues. Critically, when p.His1134Tyr and p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu were combined under these conditions, mtDNA replication was severely diminished and featured prominent stalling.

"DNA polymerase gamma (POLγ ) is a nuclear-encoded protein that replicates mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Human POLγ is a heterotrimer comprising the catalytic POLγ A subunit and a dimeric POLγ B processivity factor [1]. POLγ A has 51−31 DNA polymerase and 31−51 exonuclease activities, maintaining a relatively constant mtDNA copy number [1,2]. Mutations in the gene encoding POLγ A (POLG) are a common cause of mitochondrial disease, ∗ Corresponding authors. E-mail addresses: niklas.darin@vgregion.se (N.

"The boy was the first child of healthy unrelated parents with no family history of neurological disease. The mother was healthy during pregnancy, which was complicated by intrauterine growth restriction of 35%, and birth was by cesarian section after 38+2 weeks of gestation (normal ∼ 40 weeks). Birth weight was 2380 g (- 2.5 SD), length was 47 cm (- 1.5 SD) and head circumference was 33 cm (- 1 SD). The APGAR score was normal (9–10–10). From the first day of life the boy was severely floppy with sucking difficulties requiring tube feeding. During the first week of age, blood lactate levels were increased up to 7–8 mmol/L (ref. v. <1.8) with pH 7.32 (ref. v. 7.35–7.45) and Base excess at −5 (ref. v. −3 – 3). The serum creatine kinase level (S-CK) was elevated at 1616 IU/L (ref.v. <170). The results from the polarography and spectrophotometry in isolated mitochondria were in the lower range of the controls but considered normal for a child as young as two weeks of age. A TORCH-screen showed IgG-antibodies against Toxoplasma Gondii, CMV and Parvovirus that were considered to have maternal origin. Mild anemia due to AO-immunization required blood transfusion, and a mild hypocalcemia was normalized upon calcium supplementation. Clinical examination revealed the absence of eye contact, infolded thumbs, backward bending of the head, dyskinetic movements and generalized muscular hypotonus with spared antigravity movements but no head control and the absence of muscle tendon reflexes. Cardiac investigations were normal. EEG was abnormal with decreased background activity of the left hemisphere. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed increased values for Tau and neurofilament light protein. Treatment with calcium, vitamin D, coenzyme Q10, thiamine, aspartic acid, carnitine and dichloroacetate had no apparent effect on the clinical condition which continued to worsen with deteriorating liver function and increasing lactic acidosis. The serum levels of alanine transaminase increased to 62.3 U/L (ref.v. < 47.9), aspartate transaminase to 142.5 U/L (ref.v. < 53.9) and international normalized ratio to 1.4 (ref.v.<1.2).

"A muscle biopsy from the vastus lateralis of the quadriceps muscle was performed at age 2 weeks. Isolation of mitochondria, oximetric measurements on fresh mitochondria, spectrophotometric enzyme analyses, as well as muscle biopsy for ultrastructural and enzyme histochemical analyses were performed essentially as previously described [11]. Immunohistochemistry was performed with monoclonal antibodies to complex IV subunit 1 (MTCO1; Abcam; 1:4000) and a mitochondrial marker (VDAC1; Abcam; 1:2000). Longrange PCR was used to detect possible mtDNA deletions essentially as previously described [12]. To quantify mtDNA levels, a TaqMan probe-based quantitative real-time PCR was performed, as previously described [13].

The 150-bp paired-end reads were aligned to the reference genome (hg19) using the CLC Biomedical Genomics workbench (Qiagen). Data were analyzed using Ingenuity Variant Analysis (IVA) (www. ingenuity.com/products/variant-analysis). We searched for candidate genes potentially associated with mitochondrial disease and included all 1158 genes listed in MitoCarta2.0 [14], and the entire mtDNA. Further filtering was done for high quality variants classified as deleterious (missense, nonsense, indel and splice-site variants +/- 10 bp around exon boundaries) and rare (<0.5% minor allele frequency in the ExAC Browser, gnomAD or 1000 Genomes). Variants of interest were further evaluated using prediction tools: PhyloP, SIFT, PolyPhen-2, and MutationTaster. Sanger sequencing was used for confirmation and segregation analysis in the parents. For equivalent quantitation of the identified POLG mutations we analyzed RNA extracted from skeletal muscle specimen by PCR and Sanger sequencing. RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen) and reverse-transcribed into cDNA with the QuantiTect reverse transcription kit (Qiagen). PCR reactions were carried out at 25, 27 and 29 cycles respectively for all three variants and the PCR products were sequenced using standard techniques (PCR conditions and primers are available upon request).

"Whole-exome sequencing showed that the patient was heterozygous for three missense mutations in POLG, c.752C>T; p.Thr251Ile, c.1760C>T; p.Pro587Leu usually found in cis [19], and c.3400C>T; p.His1134Tyr. The variant c.3400C>T; p.His1134tyr with a CADD score of 28.800 was not present in the gnomAD and HGMD databases. The affected amino acid is in a highly conserved position among species with a Conservation phyloP p-value of 5.53 and is predicted to be highly pathogenic both by PolyPhen2 with a score of 1.00 and SIFT Function Prediction. The c.3400C>T originated from the father and the cis mutations from the mother (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, expression analysis on POLG cDNA from skeletal muscle specimens revealed approximately equal amounts of transcript from both alleles, excluding the possible involvement of a promoter variant in either allele (Supplementary Fig. 1).",1

"induces thermal destabilization (.6.Tm: - 2.3 °C) whereas the p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu double mutant shows near wildtype stability (Fig. 3A). This is in good agreement with the predicted .6.Gunf changes from the site directed mutator algorithm [20]. Modeling of the mutant POLγ A residues (Fig. 3B) show the p.His1134Tyr mutation located within the POLγ A active site where Asp890 and Glu1136 bind catalytically essential Mg2+ions whilst Tyr951 and Tyr955 on the catalytic O-helix are involved in dNTP binding/recognition (Fig. 3C). A Tyr1134 residue would likely protrude into the dNTP binding pocket, causing a steric clash with the incoming dNTP and displacement of the bound Mg2+ ions (Fig. 3C). The Pro587 interacts closely with the POLγ B accessory subunitwith a Leu587 residue causing a steric clash with the subunitwhilst the p.Thr251Ile mutation may result in the loss of two stabilizing H-bonds with Leu247 and Glu248 (Fig. 3D, E) that may cause a local structure change.",0

"polymerase/exonuclease assay using the short template and different dNTP levels (Fig. 4B). The exonuclease activity of both mutants was similar to wild type (no dNTPs present, Fig. 4B, Supplementary Fig. 2A). However, p.His1134Tyr polymerization was reduced compared to p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu and wild type, particularly at low dNTP concentrations (Fig. 4B, lanes 7–10). On long ssDNA templates, p.His1134Tyr showed difficulty polymerizing even at high dNTP levels, whereas p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu behaved as wild type at all concentrations (Supplementary Fig. 2B and Fig. 4C).",0
"To study polymerase activity within the context of the core mitochondrial replisome (POLγ , TWINKLE and, mtSSB), we performed a rolling circle assay using a double-stranded circular DNA template with a pre-formed replication fork (Fig. 5A). We used very high dNTP levels (100 μM) since p.His1134Tyr requires higher dNTP concentration than normal (Fig. 4B). Similar to our previous assays, p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu synthesized long DNA stretches with an efficiency comparable to wild type, whereas p.His1134Tyr was inactive despite high dNTP levels (Fig. 5B).",0

We therefore decided to investigate the effect of dNTP concentration in the rolling circle assay (Fig. 5C and D). Interestingly, at more physiological (1–10 μM) dNTP concentrations and on dsDNA templates, we now saw a strong reduction in DNA synthesis also with p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu. p.His1134Tyr in combination with p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu leads to replication stalling at low dNTP levels",0
"To mimic the DNA replication conditions within the patient cells, we mixed equimolar amounts of p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu and p.His1134Tyr in rolling circle assays at physiological dNTP concentrations (1 μM). We also reconstituted the parental situation where equimolar amounts of wild type and p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu or p.His1134Tyr were mixed. As expected, wild type supported robust levels of rolling circle replication (Fig. 5E, lanes 2–5 and Supplementary Fig. 2C). When p.His1134Tyr was added in combination with wild type, we noted a decrease in the formation of longer replication products and increased levels of a band just above 3 kb, corresponding to the size of the",0
"input template (Fig. 5E, lanes 6–9). This effect is frequently seen with POLγ variants that have problems with processive DNA synthesis. The polymerase binds to the free 31-end and performs an idling reaction, i.e. it switches between the polymerase and exonuclease mode, leading to a gradual increase in labeling of the input template. The effect was even more pronounced when we preincubated the template with p.His1134Tyr before wild type was added (Supplementary Fig. 2C), suggesting that p.His1134Tyr can compete with wild type for binding to the 31-end of the primer. Mixing of p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu with wild type had a milder effect on replisome function (Fig. 5E, lanes 10–13 and Supplementary Fig. 2C). When p.His1134Tyr and p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu were added together, replication was more severely disturbed (Fig. 5E, compare lanes 2–5 with 14–17 and Supplementary Fig. 2C), with lower levels of long replication products and increased labeling of the input template. The fact that the two mutations have additive, negative effects on replication correlates well with the more severe patient phenotype.",0

In Alpers syndrome, which is considered to be the most severe end of the spectrum of POLG-related disease, the onset is almost always after the first months of life [6,8,9, 25-27] and only rarely at birth [7]. The p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu double mutant is considered pathogenic and is associated with a wide range of clinical phenotypes [19].

Associated with these defects we found a reduction in mtDNA copy number to 32% of age-matched controls (i.e., below the normal range), but no large-scale deletions. These results indicate that mtDNA depletion was the cause of the mitochondrial dysfunction and COX-deficient muscle fibers. There was no possibility to analyze mtDNA levels in brain or liver, but we anticipate that mtDNA depletion was also the underlying cause of disease in these organs.",1

The importance of this amino acid is supported by previous work with the p.His1134Ala mutation, for which the corresponding mutation in Drosophila melanogaster caused developmental arrest and lethality at the larval stage [18]. His1134 is a strictly conserved amino acid located near the active site of the polymerase and contacts the template strand during replication [29,30]. A tyrosine at this position appears to protrude into the active site cavity and forms a new H-bond with Thr1071.

"i.e. when the polymerase acts together with TWINKLE and the defect is more pronounced at physiological dNTP concentrations (Fig. 5C and D). Neither the Thr251Ile nor Pro587Leu mutations are close to the polymerase active site. Thr251 is located in the exonuclease domain whereas Pro587 is a conserved residue in the linker domain at the interface between POLγ A and POLγ B [31]. Interestingly, the molecular defects observed with p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu are similar to those previously described for mutations in POLγ B (Arg328Lys329 and Arg363Lys364Lys365), which efficiently performs DNA synthesis on ssDNA, but fails to support replisome function on a dsDNA template [1,33]. It is therefore possible that p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu does not affect the polymerase activity per se, but affects POLγ activity in the context of the replisome, potentially disturbing functional interactions with TWINKLE.",0
"The p.His1134Tyr mutation seems to have a mild inhibitory effect also in combination with wild type. The inhibitory effect of p.His1134Tyr is likely due to its wild type-like DNA binding ability (Fig. 4A). This means that p.His1134Tyr can compete for the primer and thereby inhibit functional DNA synthesis (seen as the 3 kb stalled product in Fig. 5E and Supplementary Fig. 2C). Apparently, this defect is not sufficiently strong to generate a disease phenotype in the father. Conclusion",0
"In summary, we have identified a novel p.His1134Tyr mutation in POLγ A which, in trans with the p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu double mutant, causes a distinct and severe molecular phenotype. Whereas the combination of p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu with other recessive POLγ A mutations often causes adult-onset mitochondrial pathologies [34-36], the combination with p.His1134Tyr is associated with intrauterine onset of disease with clinical features at birth. When combined, p.His1134Tyr and p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu cause a very severe phenotype in vitro, which can be substantially improved in the presence of higher dNTP concentrations. Deoxynucleoside combination therapy has a positive effect on patients with TK2 deficiency and our data suggest that a similar therapeutic approach can be beneficial for patients with certain disease-causing POLγ variants [37].",0

"Sensory ataxic neuropathy, dysarthria, and ophthalmoparesis (SANDO) is a rare mitochondrial disorder associated with mutations in the POLG gene, which encodes the DNA polymerase gamma catalytic subunit. A few POLG-related SANDO cases have been reported, but the genotype–phenotype correlation remains unclear. Here, we report a patient with SANDO carrying two novel missense variants (c.2543G>C, p.G848A and c.452 T>C, p.L151P) in POLG. We also reviewed previously reported cases to systematically evaluate the clinical and genetic features of POLG-related SANDO. A total of 35 distinct variants in the coding region of POLG were identified in 63 patients with SANDO. The most frequent variant was the p.A467T variant, followed by the p.W748S variant. The clinical spectrum of SANDO is heterogeneous. No clear correlation has been observed between the mutation types and clinical phenotypes. Our findings expand the mutational spectrum of POLG and contribute to clinical management and genetic counseling for POLG-related SANDO.",1

"Sensory ataxic neuropathy, dysarthria, and ophthalmoparesis (SANDO) is a rare inherited mitochondrial disorder associated with multiple mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions. It was first described in 1997 (Fadic et al. 1997). Since then, relatively few cases have been reported. Classically, the disorder presents with the triad of sensory ataxic neuropathy, dysarthria, and ophthalmoparesis. Mutations in the DNA polymerase gamma (POLG) gene, which encodes the DNA polymerase gamma catalytic subunit, have been identified as the major genetic cause of SANDO.",0
"However, diseases related to POLG mutations are heterogeneous, consisting of a wide spectrum of disorders involving multiple organs, with variable age at onset  Ling-Jing Jin lingjingjin@163.com 1 Neurotoxin Research Center of Key Laboratory of Spine and Spinal Cord Injury Repair and Regeneration of Ministry of Education, Neurological Department of Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China",0
"and varying degrees of severity. Apart from SANDO, POLG-related disorders include Alpers syndrome; autosomal dominant and recessive forms of chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia; spinocerebellar ataxia with epilepsy; mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS); and mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy syndrome (Da Pozzo et al. 2017; Rouzier et al. 2014; Tang et al. 2011). Although POLG variants have been found throughout the region from exon 2 to exon 21, no clear correlation has been identified between the phenotype and genotype.",0
"The diagnosis of SANDO is best made with genetic testing coupled with clinical findings. To date, the clinical phenotype and POLG mutational spectrum of SANDO patients have not yet been systematically evaluated. In this study, we report a case of SANDO associated with two novel heterozygous variants (c.2543G>C, p.G848A and c.452 T>C, p.L151P) in POLG. We also searched the literature on POLG-related SANDO and reviewed previously reported cases to summarize the clinical and genetic features of this disorder. Materials and Methods Subjects",0
"The patient was recruited from the Neurological Department of Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine in 2019. The patient and his parents signed written informed consent forms in accordance with the ethical protocol approved by the Ethics Board of Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine. Genetic Analysis Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples. Whole-exome sequencing of the proband was performed on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform using methods reported",1
previously (Dong et al. 2020). Sanger sequencing was carried out to verify the potential variants and co-segregation of the pedigree. Literature Review,0
"The PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), CNKI (https://www.cnki.net/), and Wanfang (http://www. wanfangdata.com.cn/) databases were used to search for previously reported cases associated with POLG-related SANDO.

"The patient was a 37-year-old man. He said he was a poor runner and was unable to keep up with his peers during childhood. He complained of fatigue after exercise. At the age of 35, he suffered from bilateral eyelid drooping. At age 36, he experienced numbness in both feet that was noticeable when standing or walking and diminished when lying",1
"down. At the same time, a hand tremor, particularly in the right hand, was observed. The tremor appeared in the resting state but disappeared when he actively used the hand. Three months before visiting our department, he exhibited a more severe hand tremor and developed slurred speech.",1
"On examination, he was 164 cm tall and weighed only 45 kg. Neurological examinations showed normal cognition. He had a moderate nasal, flaccid dysarthria. There was bilateral ptosis with moderate horizontal ophthalmoparesis without double vision. This symptom was more severe in the right eye. His muscle power was reduced in neck flexors to 3/5 grade strength (Medical Research Council Muscle Scale). He also had bilateral sternocleidomastoid muscular atrophy. Fasciculation was observed in the bilateral pectoralis major and left bicep. Excessive sweating of the palms and soles was also observed. Deep tendon reflexes were absent in all limbs. Absent vibratory sensations in the lower extremities and impaired joint position sense in the toes were observed. The finger-to-nose test was normal. His heel-knee-tibia test and Romberg sign were positive. A static tremor was evident in his right hand.",1
"Chemical laboratory investigations revealed slightly elevated levels of lactic acid up to 3.0 mmol/L (reference range 0.7–2.1 mmol/L), while his creatine kinase, glucose, vitamin B12, thyroid function, and autoantibody levels were all within normal ranges. His electrocardiogram (ECG) test was normal, showing no arrhythmia. Nerve conduction studies revealed absent right sural and peroneal sensory nerve action potentials (SNAP), along with moderately reduced radial, median, and ulnar SNAP, consistent with sensory axonopathy. Motor studies demonstrated reduced compound muscle action potentials (CMAP) in the lower limbs. His F-wave latencies were normal. A needle electromyographic (EMG) study of his right arm and leg showed some high-amplitude, longduration motor unit action potentials, with fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves. Lower limb somatosensory evoked potentials were absent. No noticeable abnormalities were seen on MRI of the spinal cord. Periventricular white matter hyperintensities were observed on T2-weighted/fluid attenuated inversion recovery (T2/FLAIR) brain MRI (Fig. 1).",1
"Genetic Findings Whole-exome sequencing was performed to screen for possible causative genes for these symptoms. Two novel heterozygous missense variants in compound heterozygosity, c.2543G>C (p.G848A) and c.452 T>C (p.L151P) in POLG (NM_002693.2) were identified as candidate disease-causing variants after verification by Sanger sequencing. Family co-segregation analysis demonstrated that these variants were inherited from his asymptomatic mother and father (Fig. 1). The variant p.G848A affects Table 2 POLG variants identified in SANDO patients",1
"Nucleotide variant Amino acid alteration Exon Domain Frequency No. of patients MU mutant, WT wild type the same amino acid as a previously reported mutation (p.G848S) (Weiss and Saneto 2010). These two novel variants were found at a low frequency in the public database and were predicted to be damaging by PolyPhen-2 [Polymorphism Phenotyping v2] and CADD [Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion] software programs. Moreover, both variant sites are conserved throughout vertebrate species (Supplementary Table 2). Literature Review",0
"Overall, 63 SANDO patients carrying homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in POLG were included in this",0
"study. Their clinical and molecular data are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. The mean age at onset of POLGrelated SANDO was 32.2 years (range, 5–73 years), with 96.7% of patients developing symptoms before the age of 50. Most patients were prompted to seek medical advice because of gait ataxia and progressive ptosis. Multiple organs were affected in SANDO patients. Common additional symptoms included proximal muscle weakness, dysphagia, cognitive deficits, movement disorders, and psychiatric disorders (Table 1). Except for one SANDO patient carrying a homozygous p.A889T variant, who presented with demyelinating neuropathy, all of the patients were characterized by axonal neuropathy.",0
"Muscle histological analysis revealed that a majority of patients had a histological pattern of mitochondrial myopathy with ragged-red fibers (RRFs, 18/25) and cytochrome c oxidase (COX)- negative fibers (23/30). Multiple mtDNA deletions were present in the muscle specimens of all but one patient (21/22). In addition, brain MRI anomalies were identified in some patients. Major brain MRI features included cerebellar atrophy (9/36) and cerebellar lesions (6/36).",0
A total of 35 distinct variants in the coding region of the POLG gene have been identified so far in SANDO patients (Table 2). These variants are distributed throughout the coding region of POLG and are mainly concentrated in the linker region and the polymerase domain (Fig. 1). The bioinformatic characterization of these variants is presented in Supplementary Table 2. The most frequently detected POLG variant associated with SANDO is the p.A467T variant (30.9% of alleles) followed by the p.W748S variant (20.9% of alleles). Discussion,0
"In this report, we describe two novel variants in the POLG gene in a patient with SANDO, hand tremors, and exercise intolerance. These two variants, p.L151P and p.G848A, are located in the N-terminal and polymerase domains of POLG, respectively. Based on the clinical manifestation and genetic analysis, this patient was diagnosed with SANDO.",1
"To date, 35 distinct variants throughout the coding region of the POLG gene have been detected in SANDO patients (Bereau et al. 2016; Hanisch et al. 2015; Horvath et al. 2006; Hou Yue et al. 2018; Posada et al. 2010; Rajakulendran et al. 2016; Van Goethem et al. 2003; Winterthun et al. 2005). The POLG gene encodes the DNA polymerase gamma catalytic subunit, which forms a heterotrimeric DNA polymerase gamma with the accessory subunit encoded by DNA polymerase subunit gamma-2, mitochondrial (POLG2). DNA polymerase gamma is involved in mtDNA maintenance. Mutations in POLG reduce the activity of DNA polymerase gamma, leading to mtDNA deletions. Mitochondrial dysfunction impairs cellular metabolism. Among these variants in POLG identified in SANDO patients, the p.A467T variant is the most common. However, this variant is not specific to SANDO (Kurt et al. 2010).",0
"Classically, SANDO presents with the aforementioned triad of sensory ataxic neuropathy, dysarthria, and ophthalmoparesis. However, there is wide phenotypical variation among SANDO patients. Patients with the disease can display additional symptoms of multiple organ involvement, including cerebellar ataxia (Milone et al. 2008), dysphagia (Bereau et al. 2016), parkinsonism (Batla et al. 2015), chorea (Bereau et al. 2016), cognitive deficits (Lovan et al. 2013), diabetes (Horvath et al. 2006), constipation (Gati",0
"et al. 2011), and cardiomyopathy (Horvath et al. 2006). In addition, muscle biopsy indicated that some patients did not show RRFs or COX-negative fibers (Hanisch et al. 2015; Milone et al. 2008; Rouzier et al. 2014). This wide variation in patient presentation often makes diagnosis difficult. Support for the diagnosis of SANDO comes from the patient’s clinical history, electrophysiology, histology, and genetic testing.",0
"In our patient, a resting tremor was observed in his right hand. According to a literature review, symptoms of movement disorders such as chorea, tremors, and parkinsonism were reported in 13 SANDO patients harboring 12 distinct POLG mutations (Bereau et al. 2016; Habek et al. 2012; Van Goethem et al. 2004). However, the exact pathogenesis is not clear. It has been reported that mitochondrial dysfunction is related to the occurrence of parkinsonism (Batla et al. 2015). Among the POLG-related SANDO patients, a majority (24/35) also exhibited brain MRI anomalies, including cerebellar lesions, thalamic lesions, white matter lesions, cerebellar atrophy, cortical atrophy, and hypertrophic olivary degeneration (Bostan et al. 2012; Gebus et al. 2018; Henao et al. 2016; Richter et al. 2018). Recent studies have shown that the levels of dopamine transporters were reduced in the bilateral striata of SANDO patients with parkinsonism (Batla et al. 2015; Miguel et al. 2014). In addition, histological examination revealed degenerative changes in the substantia nigra, dentate nucleus, and red nuclei, as well as striking bilateral hypertrophy of the inferior olive in a patient with POLGrelated SANDO. These pathological findings are in line with prior brain MRI findings and may partially explain the occurrence of movement disorders in SANDO patients. In conclusion, this study reported two novel POLG variants in a patient with SANDO. POLG-related SANDO is a rare heterogeneous mitochondrial disorder with multiple organ involvement. Our findings expand the mutational spectrum of POLG and will be useful in clinical management and genetic counseling for patients with POLG-",0

"The POLG gene encodes mitochondrial DNA polymerase, and mutations in this gene cause a spectrum of disorders related to mitochondrial DNA depletion or deletion. Dystonia has only rarely been reported as an early and prominent manifestation of POLG mutations. We report a case of a 30-year-old male presenting with lower limb dystonia with peripheral neuropathy and demonstrate that the dystonia was levodopa responsive (with video findings). Whole-genome sequencing revealed biallelic variants in the POLG gene: a known pathogenic variant [NM_001126131.2:c.2209G>C (p.Gly737Arg)] and a novel likely pathogenic variant [NM_001126131.2:c.3305A>C (p.Gln1102Pro)]. A genetic diagnosis was made before the appearance of more readily recognizable features of mitochondrial disease, allowing us to avoid invasive tissue biopsies or potentially deleterious treatments, such as sodium valproate. A POLG-related disorder should be suspected in cases of dystonia with peripheral neuropathy, and this diagnosis may have implications for further investigations and management.",1
"Key Words Dystonia; Genetics; Peripheral Neuropathies; Parkinsonism; POLG. The POLG gene encodes the catalytic subunit of mitochondrial DNA polymerase called DNA polymerase gamma. POLG is a nuclear gene responsible for mitochondrial replication. Mutations in this gene can result in quantitative mitochondrial depletion, typically manifesting as one of a heterogeneous group of recessive early onset syndromes or syndromes caused by qualitative mitochondrial deletions that often arise later in life.1",0
"POLG mutations represent the most common cause of inherited nuclear DNA-encoded mitochondrial disorders.1 POLGrelated disorders encompass a spectrum of disorders, including mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome type 4A (Alpers) and 4B (mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy), mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndromes (sensory ataxic neuropathy, dysarthria, ophthalmoparesis, and spinocerebellar ataxia",0
"with epilepsy) and progressive external ophthalmoplegia type 1 (dominant and recessive). Pediatric patients have a predominance of seizures, hepatopathy, and lactic acidaemia, whereas patients developing symptoms in adulthood are more frequently affected by myopathy, sensory ataxia, and chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia.2 POLG mutations are also known to be implicated in one of many mitochondrial diseases associated with disorders of movement.3,4",0
There are few reports in the literature of a POLG-related disorder with prominent dystonia at presentation.5 We report a proband presenting with dystonia and peripheral neuropathy who was found to have biallelic disease-causing variants in the POLG gene. CASE REPORT,1
"A 30-year-old male born of nonconsanguineous parents presented with asymmetric tremor and dystonia, bradykinesia and sensory symptoms that began at 23 years of age. He first noted a tremor in his right leg, which was initially present on exertion only. In the following year, he noted some impairment in balance and coordination that was exacerbated with eye closure and in the dark. Subsequently, his leg tremor became more pronounced, spreading to involve the left leg. This tremor was associated with involuntary inversion of the feet and right thumb flexion, head posturing, and paresthesia in the right foot. Dystonia and tremor were absent when supine, and there was a diurnal component occurring only several hours after awakening. There was no relevant past medical history or family history.",1
"On presentation, the patient had a weight of 73 kg and a height of 170 cm. He was alert and reported no issues with work and daily activities, scoring 28/30 on the MMSE with two points lost for short-term memory. Cranial nerve examination was normal apart from subtle rotatory nystagmus looking up and out bilaterally. There was no resting tremor in the upper limbs, but bilateral dystonic inversion of the feet was noted (Supplementary Video 1 in the online-only Data Supplement). Repetitive finger taps and finger movements were mildly bradykinetic bilaterally. Repetitive heel and foot taps were moderately slowed bilaterally, and this feature was more evident on the left. Tone and power were both preserved throughout the upper and lower limbs. There were no appendicular cerebellar signs. Sensory examination revealed bilateral reduced vibration to the level of the ankles distally and impairment of joint proprioception in the great toes. Reflexes were absent with reinforcement in both the upper and lower limbs, and plantar responses were flexor. In the upright position, occasional high amplitude rhythmic tremor was noted in the right leg. His gait was broad-based. After 20 meters, the dystonic foot inversion was accentuated, and the right toe became extensor. His tremor abated in the supine position. He was unable to perform tandem walking but could walk on heels and toes with hand-holding support for balance. Romberg’s test was positive. Nerve conduction studies and somatosensory evoked potentials revealed evidence of moderate to severe generalized sensory length-dependent axonal polyneuropathy. Investigations for metabolic, infectious, and immune-mediated neuropathies and movement disorders were unremarkable with bland cerebrospinal fluid and no abnormalities on MRI brain and whole spine.",1
Muscle biopsy and assessment for mitochondrial depletion or multiple deletions were not performed. A trial of low-dose levodopa/benserazide uptitrated to 300 mg of daily levodopa was performed with a significant improvement in tremor and dystonia (Supplementary Video 1 in the online-,1
"only Data Supplement) without significant side effects, and the patient was able to continue full-time work. However, in the last four years, he developed incipient progressive external ophthalmoplegia; a resting tremor in the right upper limb; occasional myoclonic jerks in the shoulder, arm, forearm and distal fingers; appendicular cerebellar dysfunction; and mild bilateral foot drop. The patient underwent whole-genome sequencing as reported.6 Although not detected on initial analysis, two POLG variants were later established as disease-relevant following clinical and genetic re-evaluation: NM_001126131.2:c.2209G>C (p. Gly737Arg) (pathogenic, PS1, PM2, PP2, PP3, PP5) as previously reported7,8 and a variant not previously associated with human disease, NM_001126131.2:c.3305A>C (p.Gln1102Pro) (likely pathogenic PM1, PM2, PP2, PP3). The POLG variants were shown to affect both alleles in a family study (Figure 1). On review of our whole genome sequencing database from the initial study (n = 111 probands with dystonia), this was the only proband who could be characterized as ‘dystonia and periph-",1
eral neuropathy.’ DISCUSSION,0
"We report a case of dystonia and peripheral neuropathy caused by compound heterozygous POLG mutations, including a new likely pathogenic variant (p.Gln1102Pro). The known pathogenic variant (p.Gly737Arg) has previously been identified with compound heterozygosity in two siblings with a similar presentation of early-onset parkinsonism, dystonic toe curling, action tremor, bradykinesia and a sensorimotor axonal peripheral neuropathy in their twenties with partial response to dopamine8 in conjunction with another known pathogenic variant of POLG. This is one of only a few instances whereby dystonia was reported as a prominent manifestation of a POLG-related disor-",1

"Complex hyperkinetic movement disorders Mixture of dystonia, myclonus, chorea der. It is now apparent that POLG mutations can manifest with a wide range of movement disorders (Table 1). Differentials for “dystonia with peripheral neuropathy” include Refsum disease and PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration. However, peripheral neuropathy is a well-established manifestation of POLG mutations and may initially present as Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT). In fact, a recent study reported a patient presenting with CMT with one of the same mutations described in this case (p.Gly737Arg).7",0
"This report provides further evidence that the phenotype of “dystonia with peripheral neuropathy” may be due to a POLGrelated disorder.9 Notably, from our original whole genome sequencing study, this proband was the only one identified to have both peripheral neuropathy and dystonia out of 111 probands with heterogeneous dystonia phenotypes. Other dystonia phenotypes of POLG mutations include “dystonia with cerebellar ataxia” and “dystonia with myoclonus,”9 so POLG-related disorders should also be considered more broadly as a cause of dystonia with cooccurring neurological manifestations.",0
"In this case, the genetic diagnosis was made prior to the appearance of readily recognizable features of mitochondrial disease such as progressive external ophthalmoplegia. Of importance, the diagnosis had implications for further investigations and management of this patient. The identification of POLG mutations as the genetic cause obviated the need for invasive investigations, such as muscle or nerve biopsies, which may have posed additional harm to the patient. The diagnosis may also guide the prescription of medications in the future, as we can avoid medications that are known to exacerbate POLG-related disorders, such as sodium valproate, which can precipitate liver failure.1 Sodium valproate may be considered in the eventuality of a seizure disorder, a known complication of POLG mutations. Furthermore, our case showed a clear response to levodopa therapy. A sustained long-term response to levodopa has also been previously described in a case of dystonia with autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia type 1,5 emphasizing the importance of the use of levodopa in patients with dystonia-re-",0
"lated POLG mutations. Finally, we highlight the benefit of periodic re-evaluation of genomic data, which can reveal additional diagnoses over time, providing long-term future value for patient healthcare.10",0
"In summary, we highlight POLG mutations as an exemplar of the “dystonia with peripheral neuropathy” phenotype and that the dystonia in POLG-related disorders may be levodopa responsive. Clinicians should consider POLG mutations when presented with this combination of neurological manifestations, particularly given that this may have implications for the further investigations and management of their patients.

"Background Mitochondrial disorders are clinically heterogeneous diseases associated with impaired oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activity. POLG, which encodes the DNA polymerase-γ (Polγ) catalytic subunit, is the most commonly mutated nuclear gene associated with mitochondrial disorders.",0
"Methods We carried out whole-exome sequencing (WES) to identify the gene associated with progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO). We then performed histopathological analyses, assessed mitochondrial biology, and executed functional studies to evaluate the potential pathogenicity of the identified genetic mutations.",0
"Results Novel biallelic POLG mutations, including a large deletion mutation (exons 7–21) and a missense variant c.1796C>T (p.Thr599Ile) were detected in the proband. Histopathological analysis of a biopsied muscle sample from this patient revealed the presence of approximately 20% COX-negative fibers. Bioinformatics analyses confirmed that the detected mutations were pathogenic. Furthermore, levels of mitochondrial complex I, II, and IV subunit protein expressions were found to be decreased in the proband, and marked impairment of mitochondrial respiration was evident in cells harboring these mutations.",1
Conclusion This study expands the spectrum of known POLG variants associated with PEO and advances current understanding regarding the structural and functional impacts of these mutations.

"(OXPHOS) defects [1, 2]. These disorders can originate from mutated nuclear DNA (nDNA) or in maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) [2, 3]. Over 1100 nDNA-encoded proteins are found in mitochondria, including OXPHOS subunits, assembly factors, and proteins related to other essential mitochondrial functions [4].",0
"mtDNA polymerase γ (Polγ) is a key regulator of mtDNA replication and homeostasis [5–7]. Human Polγ is a heterotrimeric protein complex containing the catalytic 140kDa POLG subunit encoded by POLG (MIM 174763) on chromosome 15q25 and the 55-kDa accessory subunit POLG2 encoded by POLG2 (MIN 604983) on chromosome 17q24.1[7]. POLG possesses both 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity and 5′ → 3′ polymerization activity. POLG genetic variants affect mtDNA stability and nucleotide metabolism, resulting in mtDNA defects including deletions, depletions, base-pair substitutions, and rearrangements, which can in turn give rise to mitochondrial diseases [5, 8, 9].",0
POLG is the nuclear gene that is most often mutated in the context of mitochondrial disorders. Van Goethem et al. first,0
"reported a POLG variant in a Belgian patient with progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) in 2001 [10]. Since then, POLG has been the focus of intensive research. To date, there are approximately 300 related POLG variants have been documented (http://tools.niehs.nih. gov/polg/), the majority of which are point mutations, whereas POLG deletion mutations are extremely rare and have been identified only sporadically. POLG variant-related disorders are associated with a heterogeneous array of pathogenic mechanisms, clinical presentations, and outcomes. Neurological disorders may include devastating infantile disorders such as AlpersHuttenlocher syndrome (AHS), mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndrome (MIRAS), myocerebrohepatopathy spectrum (MCHS), juvenile and adult-onset myoclonic epilepsy, ataxia neuropathy spectrum (ANS), sensory ataxia neuropathy dysarthria and ophthalmoplegia (SANDO), and mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy (MNGIE). Such variants can also cause late-onset disorders including myopathies such as PEO and certain movement disorder syndromes [5, 11–15].",0
"PEO, which is the most prevalent form of mitochondrial myopathy, usually presents with progressive bilateral ptosis, diffuse symmetric ocular motility reductions, and exercise intolerance [16, 17]. Approximately half of all PEO cases originate from nDNA mutations in genes like POLG, POLG2, SLC25A4, C10orf2, TWINKLE, PEO1, RRM2B, TK2, or OPA1 [16, 18–21]. The most prevalent POLG pathogenic variants include c.1399G>A (p.A467T) and c.2344G>C (p.W748S), which are closely related to autosomal-dominant (AD) and/or autosomal-recessive(AR) PEO [8, 22–24].",0
"In our study, we report the case of a 33-year-old male with PEO harboring novel biallelic mutations in the POLG gene, including a large deletion mutation (exons 7–21) and a missense variant c.1796C>T (p.Thr599Ile). We confirmed the pathogenicity of these mutations based on a combination of clinical, genetical, and biochemical investigations. Materials and methods Subject",1
"This 33-year-old male was the only child born to a nonconsanguineous healthy couple. The patient first presented with strabismus and ptosis 9 months ago, accompanied by the gradual development of ophthalmoplegia. Aside from these ocular complaints, he did not report any other clinically relevant symptoms. The patient had no family history of known mitochondrial disease. A neurologic examination revealed bilateral ptosis, left exotropia (20 prism diopters), and ophthalmoparesis associated with mildly restricted eye movement. Reflexes, strength, and sensation examinations were all normal for this patient. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),",1
"electromyography (EMG), blood testing, and electroencephalography (EEG) findings were all normal. Informed consent for diagnosis and research studies was received from the patient. The study protocol was agreed upon the ethics committee of Qilu Hospital. Genomic analysis",0
"After informed consent was provided, total genomic DNA was isolated from the peripheral blood and/or biopsied skeletal muscle samples from the proband and his parents using a DNA Isolation Kit (Blood DNA Kit V2, CW2553). Purification was then performed with Agencourt AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter), and targeted DNA samples were sequenced via whole-exome sequencing (WES) according to standard Illumina protocols using a Novaseq 6000 platform. The Burrows-Wheeler Alignment (BWA) Tool was used to align paired-end 200-bp reads to the human reference genome (hg19). Data were then collected and subjected to bioinformatics analyses, and candidate variants were analyzed based upon American College Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines. Traditional Sanger sequencing was employed for the confirmation of the identified variants and to test the carrier status of clinically unaffected family members.",0
mtDNA deletion analysis DNA was obtained from muscle biopsies and peripheral blood samples from the proband according to standard protocols. The entire mitochondrial genome was screened via wholeexome sequencing (WES) and long-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Identification of pathogenic POLG variants,0
"The pathogenicity of novel missense variants was assessed based on the following criteria: (1) the variants exhibited full disease phenotype co-segregation; (2) the involved amino acid residue was conserved; (3) the mutation was predicted to be associated with functional consequences according to analyses conducted using SIFT (http://www.sift.jcvi.org/), MutationTaster (http://www.mutationtaster.org), and PolyPhen (http://www.genetics. bwh.harvard.edu/pph/); (4) the affected amino acid was located in important functional domains; (5) a distinct disease-causing variant was known to exist at the same position; and (6) the variant was absent in 100 normal controls.",0
"Crystal structure determination The structural impact of POLG variants was visualized and analyzed using the holoenzyme coordinate sets (pdb code: 5c53) and PyMOL (v2.0.6). A point variant model was produced using UCSF chimera. A large deletion predictive model was generated using the I-Tasser, Phyre2, and SWISSMODEL programs [25–27]. Histopathological examination",0
"A left biceps brachii biopsy sample was taken from the proband, with serial 10-μm-thick cryosections being stained based on conventional histological protocols [28]. Staining approaches used were as follows: hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, NADH-tetrazolium reductase staining, cytochrome c oxidase (COX) staining, modified Gomori trichrome (MGT) staining, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) staining, and SDH-COX double staining following incubation at a pH of 4.3 and 10.4. Cell culture and cell line generation",0
"Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) was used to immortalize lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) based upon a published protocol [29]. This approach was used to prepare cell lines from both the patient and ageand sex-matched healthy volunteers.

Results Recognizing novel pathogenic POLG mutations",0
"Using a WES approach, we identified two novel biallelic POLG mutations in the proband patient, including a large deletion mutation between exons 7 and 21 and a missense variant in exon 10 (c.1796C>T, p.Thr599Ile). To identify the breakpoints of the deleted allele, a PCR assay was then designed, and subsequent PCR product sequencing revealed a large 9223-bp deletion within POLG (chr15: 89,861,596-89,870,890).",1
"When this region was further analyzed via long-range PCR, the large intragenic deletion was confirmed de novo (Fig. 1D, E). The novel missense variant (c.1796C>T, p.T599I) was inherited from the proband’s",0

Genomic DNA sequencing revealed novel biallelic mutations in the POLG gene, including a missense variant (exon 10, c.1796C>T, p.Thr599Ile) inherited from the father, and a spontaneous large deletion mutation (E7–E21). Owing to the large deletion, the missense variant was homozygous in the proband. A multi-alignment analysis demonstrated that the affected amino acid residue was highly conserved among different species. The PolyPhen-2",0

A full-length product (9553 bp) was detectable in the mother (I-1), the father (I-2), the patient (II-1), and a healthy control (C). However, a 260-bp deletion product was also detected in a heterozygous state in the patient (primers: forward 5′-gctaaggctgaagaaaataaatgtgt-3′ and reverse 5′-attttccaaatagaaaagcgtgagta-3′).

"father. There are no prior records of these two variants in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD, www. hgmd.cf.ac.uk/) or on PubMed. A multi-alignment analysis further demonstrated that this missense variant modulated highly conserved amino acids. The PolyPhen-2 and Mutation Taster prediction programs further indicated that the c.1796C>T variant was damaging, while SIFT predicted this variant to be tolerated (Fig. 1B, C). The effect of the detected mutations on POLG structure",0
"We assessed the impact of these biallelic mutations on the structure of Polγ. Interactive visualizations of this holoenzyme, which consists of the catalytic POLG subunit and the homodimeric POLG2 accessory subunit, were constructed using PyMOL. Predictive protein",0
"structural analyses of the large deletion in POLG were analyzed via three computational approaches. Despite the presence of the exonuclease domain in the mutant protein, the majority of the polymerase domain was removed by this deletion, and this mutation was predicted to be highly disruptive to the enzymatic functionality (Fig. 2A). Using the UCSF Chimera program, we next created a model of the T599I substitution. The hydrogen bond between threonine 599 and serine 593 was predicted to stabilize the linkage between the polymerase and spacer domain, as well as the binding of DNA to this enzyme. Relative to the wild-type enzyme, this mutant isoform exhibited significant structural changes. Based upon the structural position of T599 and its interactions with surrounding amino acids, we speculated that polymorphisms affecting residues 592, 593, 594, and 595 may also interfere with the structural stability of POLG (Fig. 2B).",0

"mtDNA deletion analysis Deep mitochondrial genome sequencing conducted by NGS and long-range PCR amplification revealed the presence of a substantial mtDNA deletion (positions 5836-13922) in muscle samples but not blood samples from this patient, suggesting that the presence of mtDNA deletion is more common in postmitotic tissues in this genetic context (Supplementary Fig. 1). Histopathological analysis",0
"Serial biceps brachii sections revealed pathological feature of typical mitochondrial disease. About 20% COX-negative fibers were observed upon MGT staining, with the majority being ragged red fibers (RRFs). SDH and S/C staining also revealed ragged blue fibers (RBFs) and blue-staining fibers, respectively, further supporting the diagnosis of mitochondrial disease (Fig. 3). Mitochondrial protein level reductions",1
"To assess whether the identified variants affected OXPHOS subunit expression, we examined the levels of mtDNAencoded respiratory complex subunits expression and the nDNA-encoded respiratory complex subunits expression in muscle tissues and LCLs via Western blot. GAPDH or βactin were used as endogenous controls for these Western blotting assays.

Respiration deficiencies in mutant LCLs",1
"In order to further investigate whether these identified variants modulated cellular bioenergetic activity, we next utilized a Seahorse XFe24 instrument to analyze control and mutant LCL respiratory functionality. Basal OCR in the resting state was reduced by 26.1% (P = 0.013) in mutant LCLs relative to control LCLs. We additionally employed electron transport chain (ETC) inhibitors or uncoupling agents to gauge the impact of the tested mutations on mitochondrial function in these cells. Relative to control cells, the ATP generation, proton leakage, maximum respiration, and spare capacity OCR values in mutant cells were lowered to 63.1% (P = 0.012), 72.3% (P = 0.203), 39.2% (P = 0.001), and 23.5% (P <",0
", respectively (Fig. 5A, B). To elucidate the sitespecific regulation of this variant on mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) activities, we examined complex I-, II-, and IVmediated respiration in permeabilized LCLs. We discovered that mutant LCLs displayed marked reductions in all complex I-, II-, and IV-mediated respiration, as opposed to control LCLs (61.9%, 44.9%, and 83.7%, respectively) (Fig. 5C, D). Discussion",0
"Herein, we described novel biallelic POLG mutations in a 33-year-old male with PEO, including a large deletion mutation (exons 7 – 21 ) and a missense variant c.1796C>T (p.Thr599Ile). Several lines of evidence suggested the pathogenicity of these novel biallelic mutations. First, this patient exhibited clinical symptoms and histological features consistent with adult-onset PEO. Second, these genetic defects co-segregated with the observed phenotype in the affected family. Third, large mtDNA deletions were identified in muscle samples from this patient. Fourth, these biallelic mutations resulted in reduced mitochondrial respiratory complex expression, with a particularly notable impact on the levels of complex I, II, and IV subunit expressions in the analyzed samples. Finally, LCLs carrying these variants exhibited marked mitochondrial dysfunction.",1
"POLG is the nuclear gene that is most often found to be mutated in the context of mitochondrial disease [31]. Missense variants, accounting for 90% of reported POLG variants, are the most common form of such mutations. Deletion variants, however, are extremely rare, and have been identified only sporadically to date [5, 32]. In 2011, Tang et al. first reported a heterozygous large intragenic deletion (exons 15–21) with a common p.Ala467Thr variant in the POLG gene in an",0

In total, 5 μg of total protein from the muscle tissue of the patient (P) and controls (C) was analyzed. GAPDH was used as a loading control.

"CO4, SDHB, and NDUFB8). In total, 20 μg samples of protein from mutant and control LCLs were analyzed. β-Actin was used as a loading control. The average levels of mitochondrial protein levels in mutant LCLs were compared to those in the control group. Values are from three separate experiments",0
"Alpers syndrome patient [33]. In 2014, Rouzier et al. demonstrated the presence of a heterozygous large intragenic deletion mutation (intron 21–exon 22) and a p.Trp748Ser mutation in a child with refractory epilepsia partialis continua [34]. According to the ACMG guidelines for the classification of sequence variants, large deletions are deleterious and thus represent the best candidates for pathogenic variants [35]. The case reported in the present study was the third patient found to harbor large deletion mutation in the POLG gene to date.",0
"We assessed the pathogenicity of the novel p.T599I variant. First, this variant fully co-segregated with the observed disease phenotype. The affected amino acid residue was highly conserved across various species, and the PolyPhen and MutationTaster predictive tools designated this variant as being damaging. Second, the threonine at position 599 is a crucial residue important",0
"for binding to upstream DNA. Using the PyMOL software, we found that the mutation of Thr-599 to Ile-599 disrupts hydrogen bond formation between residues 599 and 593, leading to the instability of the original hydrogen bonding framework and interfering with normal conformational transmission. Third, the novel T599I missense variant affected a highly conserved residue in the spacer domain. The spacer domain influences the conformation of the wall of the DNA-binding domain and is located between the exonuclease and polymerase domains where it is connected by the thumb subdomains [36]. Using the PyMOL and UCSF chimera programs, we found that the T599I variant blocks the DNA-binding channel and results in decreased DNAbinding affinity.",0

"A467T mutation is detected in roughly 36% of all POLG disease alleles, and it prevents the interaction between the POLG and POLG2 subunits, adversely impacting DNA synthesis and Polγ activity [38]. The W748S variant is the second most commonly documented POLG mutation in the POLG mutation database, exhibiting low-affinity DNA-binding activity and processivity but normal POLG2 interactions [39]. The G848S mutation is the third-most frequently detected POLG mutation and causes severely reduced DNA polymerase activity [40].",0
"In conclusion, we described novel biallelic POLG mutations, including a large deletion (exons 7–21) mutation and a missense variant c.1796C>T (p.T599I), which were associated with a clinical presentation of PEO in a 33-year-old male. Biochemical investigations demonstrated that these variants severely impaired mitochondrial function, thereby leading to mitochondrial disease. Our study expands the spectrum of POLG variants known to cause PEO, offering valuable new insights into POLG variants with respect to both their structural and functional consequences.",1

"Camptocormia as the main manifestation of a mutation in the POLG gene* Camptocormia como principal manifestación de mutación en el gen POLG Dear Editor: The term camptocormia refers to marked flexion of the thoracolumbar spine, which resolves with supine positions, in the absence of fixed deformity.1 This symptom may have multiple aetiologies, including parkinsonian syndromes, paraspinal myopathies, dystonia, motor neuron diseases, and functional disorders.1—3 In exceptional cases, it can also be associated with POLG mutations.",0
"We present the case of a 52-year-old man with history of mild psychomotor retardation since childhood; his father had late-onset Parkinson’s disease and his mother had essential tremor. His 2 older siblings were asymptomatic. The patient was referred to our department due to progressive anteroflexion of the trunk of 4 years’ progression, which hindered walking and was associated with poor coordination and slow movement, mainly affecting the right side; these symptoms were highly disabling. He displayed no signs of dysautonomia, with the exception of constipation.",1
"Neurological examination revealed hypomimia, moderate bilateral bradykinesia, mainly affecting the right side, and low-amplitude right-sided resting tremor. Eye movement was not restricted. When standing, the patient displayed forced anteroflexion of the trunk, with the waist at an angle of approximately 70◦ (Fig. 1). In the decubitus * Please cite this article as: Sancho Saldan˜a A, et al. Camptocormia como principal manifestación de mutación en el gen POLG.

"A complete blood analysis including copper metabolism, muscle enzymes, and lactate detected no abnormalities; serology results for syphilis and HIV were negative. A brain MRI study detected no relevant alterations. A DaTSCAN study revealed dopamine transporter inactivity in both putamina and reduced uptake in the left caudate nucleus.",1
"In the light of these findings, treatment was started with levodopa at increasing doses of up to 250 mg/6 hours, with a suboptimal response. After a 350 mg loading dose, he presented an improvement of over 30% on the UPDRS part III motor examination, with his posture improving and stabilising. The extreme anteroflexion of the trunk (Fig. 1) resolved, and he was able to carefully walk over 20 metres unassisted.",0
"Given the history of psychomotor delay and the atypical parkinsonian symptoms, we requested an exome sequencing study, which identified a heterozygous missense mutation in exon 20 of the POLG gene (C.3218c > T; p [Pro1073Leu]), located on chromosome 15. The mutation is listed on the ClinVar and HGMD databases as a pathogenic variant. Functional studies have shown that this variant also affects mitochondrial DNA replication.4",1
"Despite the lack of clear symptoms, we performed further diagnostic testing. An electromyoneurography study yielded normal results, and a multidisciplinary evaluation identified mild bilateral cataracts and predominantly sensorineural mixed hearing loss.",1
"The POLG gene encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase gamma, which is responsible for the replication of the mitochondrial genome.5 Mutations of the gene are associated with a broad spectrum of neurological syndromes, with age of onset ranging from infancy to adulthood; manifestations include epilepsy, psychiatric disorders, polyneuropathy, myopathy, ataxia, and progressive external ophthalmoplegia, and may be associated with such nonneurological conditions as cataracts, sensorineural hearing loss, and premature ovarian failure.5,6",0
"More rarely, POLG mutations may be associated with parkinsonism,7 often preceded for several years by classical Neurología 36 (2021) 388—401 Figure 1 The patient before (A) and one hour after (B) a 350 mg dose of levodopa, showing a clear improvement in the anteroflexion of the trunk.",0
"phenotypes: usually progressive external ophthalmoplegia,8 but also sensory ataxic neuropathy, dysarthria, and ophthalmoparesis (SANDO).9 In these patients, parkinsonism tends to be asymmetrical, with onset occurring around the age of 40 years and good response to levodopa.8,10 Our patient developed an atypical parkinsonian syndrome, with no evidence of other neurological characteristics associated with POLG mutations; prominent camptocormia was the most striking symptom. Additional tests performed after diagnosis identified bilateral cataracts and mild sensorineural hearing loss; these findings are associated with the mutation. This form of presentation, in which the parkinsonian syndrome is not preceded by ophthalmoparesis, has only been described in 2 patients also presenting peripheral neuropathy11 and in a patient with another pathogenic mutation in the GBA gene.12 We believe that the cause of camptocormia in our patient was parkinsonism itself, as he presented severe anteroflexion of the trunk and absence of abnormal postures in the head and neck (as would be the case for dystonic camptocormia), and posture improved (albeit suboptimally) with levodopa. Furthermore, the electromyography study showed no myopathic changes.",1
"In conclusion, our patient presented a unique phenotype of POLG mutation, presenting with camptocormia secondary to atypical parkinsonism not preceded by SANDO or progressive external ophthalmoplegia, which has rarely been described in the literature.13 POLG mutations should be considered in the differential diagnosis of atypical parkinsonism, even in patients without ophthalmoparesis or polyneuropathy.

"From a neurological viewpoint, idiopathic HS is characterised by involvement of both the central nervous system (venous thrombosis and encephalopathy) and the peripheral nervous system (peripheral neuropathy).3,4 The pathogenic mechanism of peripheral neuropathy is unclear. Although nearly all affected tissues present eosinophil infiltration, histopathology studies of the damaged nerves do not reveal direct infiltration, inflammation, or vasculitis.

"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion syndromes are a group of autosomal recessive disorders associated with a spectrum of clinical diseases, which include progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO). They are caused by variants in nuclear DNA (nDNA) encoded genes, and the gene that encodes for mtDNA polymerase gamma (POLG) is commonly involved. A splice-site mutation in POLG, c.3104+3A > T, was previously identiﬁed in three families with ﬁndings of PEO, and studies demonstrated this variant to result in skipping of exon 19.

This is the ﬁrst reported case with POLG p.Gly23Serfs∗236, discovered in a patient presenting with features of PEO.",1
"Introduction Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion syndromes (MDSs) are a diverse group of autosomal recessive disorders due to mutations in nuclear encoded genes [1]. They present with a broad phenotypic spectrum with disease manifesting in single or multiple organs, including the muscle, liver, brain, and kidney [2]. Based on the clinical phenotype, MDS can be classiﬁed into four categories: myopathic, encephalomyopathic, hepatocerebral, and neurogastrointestinal [3]. mtDNA depletion occurs when synthesis is insuﬃcient to compensate for mtDNA turnover and segregation during",0
"cell division. It is caused by defects in genes involved in mtDNA replication or in genes involved in maintaining the pool of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) via the salvage pathway [2]. In addition to depletion, these defects may also lead to replication errors resulting in multiple mtDNA deletions [4].",0
"The rate and timing of mtDNA synthesis is determined by the energy requirement of a cell [4]. mtDNA replication is independent of the cell cycle, but dNTPs are only formed by the de novo pathway during the S-phase of cell division [2]. Therefore, the salvage pathway is essential in maintaining a constant pool of dNTPs throughout the cell cycle, which is accomplished by synthesizing new dNTPs from preexisting deoxynucleosides [5]. Genes involved in the salvage pathway include TK2, DGUOK, SUCLA2, SUCLG1, RRM2B, and",0
"TYMP, and defects in any of these genes may result in mtDNA depletion due to an insuﬃcient pool of dNTPs [2]. Autosomal recessive variants in the genes involved in mtDNA synthesis (POLG, POLG2, and C10orf2) are another cause of mtDNA depletion [2]. DNA polymerase gamma is the only known polymerase involved in the replication and maintenance of mtDNA in humans [6]. It is composed of two subunits encoded by nuclear genes (POLG and POLG2). POLG at chromosomal locus 15q25 encodes the catalytic subunit and contains a carboxy-terminus polymerase domain and an amino-terminus exonuclease domain [7]. Endogenous errors by the POLG protein during replication are the primary source for point mutations occurring in mtDNA [4, 8]. POLG2 at chromosomal locus 17q24.1 encodes an accessory subunit [7]. The C10orf2 gene encodes a DNA helicase (twinkle protein), which is essential for",0
mtDNA replication [3].,0
"POLG-related disorders exist on a spectrum with at least ﬁve major phenotypes, including (1) Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome (AHS), (2) childhood myocerebrohepatopathy spectrum (MCHS), (3) myoclonic epilepsy myopathy sensory ataxia (MEMSA), (4) the ataxia neuropathy spectrum (ANS), and (5) progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) with or without sensory ataxic neuropathy, dysarthria, and ophthalmoplegia (SANDO) [9]. There is no direct correlation between speciﬁc genotypic variants and the clinical or mtDNA phenotype; patients who are homozygous for identical POLG variants may have drastically diﬀerent phenotypic ﬁndings [7, 10]. However, there are some data suggesting that the clinical phenotype correlates with the type of mtDNA alteration (deletions, depletion, or both) [7]. For example, the histopathologic ﬁndings in mitochondrial myopathies of ragged-red ﬁbers and cytochrome c oxidasenegative ﬁbers on muscle biopsy are a sign of increased mitochondria, and it correlates with the accumulation of mtDNA deletions in skeletal muscle [3, 11].",0
"Here, we report a patient with late-onset PEO who was found to carry compound heterozygous variants in POLG. One allele carried the previously characterized POLG (NM_002693.3) : c.3104 + 3A > Tsplice-site alteration, which results in skipping of exon 19 [12, 13]. The other allele harbored a previously unreported frameshift variant, POLG (NM_002693.3) : c.67_88del (p.Gly23SerfsTer236). We performed additional studies to determine the structural/ functional impact of this novel variant and its relationship to the patient’s phenotype. Case Presentation",1
"A 57-year-old female was referred for evaluation of weakness and ptosis. She reported a history of being clumsy and less athletic than her peers as a child, such as not being able to run as fast. In her early 40s, she noticed diﬃculties climbing high steps, which progressed over time. She subsequently developed distal lower extremity weakness and started tripping. She reported an episode of becoming much weaker",1
"after a streptococcus infection, which slowly improved over several months. She was ﬁrst diagnosed with ptosis around age 52 during a neurological evaluation. Her current symptoms include nonfatigable bilateral ptosis, vertical and horizontal ophthalmoplegia, bifacial weakness, weakness in the proximal and distal upper and lower extremities, worse in the lower extremities, and mild left-sided intention tremor. Electromyography demonstrated a myopathy with ﬁbrillation potentials, worse in the lower extremities, without evidence of a peripheral neuropathy. Biceps muscle biopsy showed moderate ﬁber size variation with scattered atrophic and hypertrophic ﬁbers, increased internal nuclei, fatty replacement of endomysial connective tissue on hematoxylin and eosin staining, “ragged red ﬁbers” on Gomori Trichrome, focal muscle ﬁbers with increased succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity (“ragged blue ﬁbers”), and reduced or absent cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity. Electron microscopy revealed increased mitochondria with abnormal cristae and crystalline inclusions. A diagnosis of mitochondrial myopathy was rendered.",1

"Whole-Exome Sequencing. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on DNA extracted from the patient’s muscle using the Agilent SureSelectXT Human All Exon V5+UTRs capture. Sequencing was performed on Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencing technology, and the data were analyzed for the presence of pathogenic mutations using the NextGENe software from Softgenetics and our in-house proprietary analytical pipeline. Sequencing variants were binned into groups based on their presence in databases of pathogenic variants, known disease-associated genes, and population frequency of the variant (above or below 1%). Variants in each of the bins were grouped based on whether they were “de novo” (not present in either parent), homozygous, compound heterozygous, or disruptive (stop-gain, frameshift, and canonical splice site). These were reviewed by two individuals using a “genetic” model (de novo variants for dominant conditions and homozygous or compound heterozygous variants for recessive conditions) as well as using a “candidate gene” approach based on clinical syndrome.

Southern blot performed on DNA from the patient’s muscle showed multiple mtDNA deletions (Figure 2), consistent with the expected pattern in pathogenic POLG mutations. mtDNA copy number analysis showed only 48% of the expected value when compared to simultaneously run controls, consistent with mtDNA depletion. Discussion",1
"PEO can present at any age with symptoms of bilateral ptosis and ophthalmoparesis progressing in severity over time. Inheritance occurs in both autosomal dominant and recessive fashion, and a variety of genes have been implicated in the development of PEO [7]. POLG is the most common gene associated with autosomal dominant PEO, and variants in POLG, as seen in our patient, are associated with complex and severe phenotypes [11]. With one exception, all dominant mutations in POLG are point mutations in the polymerase catalytic domain [9, 18]. Other genes implicated in autosomal dominant PEO include POLG2, OPA1, ANT1, C10orf2, RRM2B, and DNA2, which are all nuclear genes involved in maintenance and replication of mtDNA. Autosomal dominant variants in these genes lead to the development of multiple mtDNA deletions [19]. However, mtDNA depletion is not a feature of autosomal dominant conditions, as adequate amounts of all wild-type proteins are present to synthesize an appropriate amount of mtDNA [2, 11]. Autosomal recessive PEO is associated with nonfunctional variants in POLG, as well as in TYMP, DGUOK, TK2, MGM1, and RNASEH1 [19]. In recessive states, there may be complete functional absence of one of these enzymes, so in addition to mtDNA deletions, recessive variants can lead to instability and depletion of mtDNA [3, 12].",0
"Our patient harbored a novel POLG variant, p.(Gly23Serfs∗236), occurring in compound heterozygosity with a previously reported pathogenic splice-site variant, c.3104+3A > T. As the novel p.(Gly23Serfs∗236) variant causes a shift in the reading frame starting in exon 2, the resulting POLG protein is predicted to lose its normal",1
"functional domains, including the polymerase and exonuclease domains. Both variants identiﬁed in our patient are likely loss-of-function variants because mtDNA depletion was demonstrated in the patient’s skeletal muscle, and in addition, neither variant leads to an alteration in the polymerase catalytic domain. Loss-of-function variants in POLG are associated with autosomal recessive inheritance, consistent with the compound heterozygosity found in our patient.",0
"The genotype-phenotype correlation in POLG-related disorders has not been fully elucidated. Heterogeneous presentations of mitochondrial disease have been previously described in patients harboring the same POLG genotype [7, 20, 21]. This suggests the possibility of an oligogenic inheritance with other genes being involved in the disease process. However, we did not identify any additional mutations in genes involved in mitochondrial DNA maintenance. Furthermore, the common overlapping symptoms of (a) Figure 1: Continued. (b)",0

Therefore, the ﬁndings of mtDNA depletion, multiple mtDNA deletions, and the resulting phenotypic PEO can reasonably be attributed to the variants discovered in the POLG gene. The c.3104+3A > T variant has been previously reported in compound heterozygosity in four patients (three unrelated families) with phenotypic features consistent with PEO (Table 1) [12, 13].

"Mutations in nuclear-encoded genes that are involved in mitochondrial DNA replication and maintenance (e.g., POLG) have been associated with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) phenotype. These nuclear genome mutations may lead to multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions or mitochondrial DNA depletion. On the other hand, primary genetic defects of mitochondrial DNA (such as single large-scale deletion or point mutations) have also been associated with the CPEO phenotype. Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) may be a manifestation of specific syndromes that, when clinically recognized, prompt clinicians to investigate specific genetic defects. Thus, CPEO, as part of Kearns Sayre syndrome, suggests the presence of a large-scale deletion of mitochondrial DNA. However, in pure CPEO or CPEO plus phenotypes, it is more difficult to know whether causative genetic defects affect the nuclear or mitochondrial DNA. Here, we present a patient with a long-standing history of CPEO plus phenotype, in whom the sequencing of mitochondrial DNA from skeletal muscle was normal, and no other genetic defect was suspected at first. At the time of our evaluation, the presence of polyneuropathy and neuropathic pain prompted us to investigate nuclear genetic defects and, specifically, mutations in the POLG gene. Thus, the sequencing of the POLG gene revealed p.Thr251Ile and p.Pro587Leu mutations in one allele, and p.Ala467Thr mutation in another allele. Although one would expect that mutations in POLG lead to multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions or depletion (loss of copies), the absence of mitochondrial DNA abnormalities in tissue may be explained by heteroplasmy, a lack or no significant involvement of biopsied tissue, or a sampling bias. So, the absence of secondary mitochondrial DNA alterations should not discourage clinicians from further investigating mutations in nuclear-encoded genes. Lastly, mitochondrial point mutations and single mitochondrial DNA deletions very rarely cause CPEO associated with polyneuropathy and neuropathic pain, and POLG-related disease should be considered in this scenario, instead.",1
"Keywords: CPEO, polyneuropathy, neuropathic pain, POLG, mitochondrial disease INTRODUCTION",0
"The human DNA polymerase gamma is formed by a 140 kDa catalytic subunit called POLG and a 55 kDa dimeric accessory subunit called POLG2. The POLG is encoded by the POLG gene (Chr.15q25) and the POLG2 is encoded by the POLG2 gene (Chr.17q24.1). The POLG has DNA polymerase, 3′ to 5′ exonuclease, and 5′-deoxyribose activities, whereas POLG2 increases the affinity of POLG for mitochondrial DNA. Thus, the DNA polymerase gamma is entirely encoded by nuclear genes, although its main role is the replication of mitochondrial DNA. The POLG and POLG2 mutations may lead to multiple deletions or depletion (loss of copies) of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and have been associated with a broad spectrum of phenotypes such as chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) (1).",0
"CPEO is a slow, progressive, and painless ocular myopathy characterized by bilateral ptosis and limitation of ocular movements in all directions that is not usually associated with diplopia because, as in other ocular myopathies, no significant misalignment occurs between both eyes. Although other myopathies, such as oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, oculopharyngeal distal myopathy, or MHY2-myopathy, are also characterized by progressive ptosis with or without ophthalmoplegia, the term CPEO usually refers to mitochondrial ocular myopathies due to either mutation in mitochondrial or nuclear DNA. The CPEO may occur in isolation (pure CPEO), as part of specific syndromes, or associated with a constellation of clinical manifestations that have not been recognized as syndrome or disorder (CPEO plus). Thus, CPEO is a characteristic feature of Kearns Sayre syndrome (KSS) that is caused by a large-scale 1.1 to 10 kilobase deletion of mtDNA, and it can also be seen as a clinical manifestation of dominantly or recessively inherited POLG-related disease; mutations in this nuclear gene account for 25% of patients with CPEO phenotype (2–6).",0
"Here, we report a patient who presented to us for evaluation of polyneuropathy and neuropathic pain as main symptoms, which were previously thought to be unrelated to her long-standing ocular myopathy for which no specific etiology was initially found. Although polyneuropathies are frequent (and commonly idiopathic in the absence of diabetes), they can be a manifestation of a mitochondrial disorder. Furthermore, polyneuropathy has been reported as a predictor of nuclear gene defects in patients with CPEO, and more specifically, the presence of neuropathic pain should prompt the clinician to consider POLG-related disease as an unifying diagnosis (7, 8).",1
"CASE DESCRIPTION A 69-year-old woman was referred to us for paresthesia, neuropathic pain, and cramps in extremities as her main symptoms. She was in good health until her early 50s when she first experienced slowly progressive bilateral ptosis that was surgically corrected twice, and restriction of eye movements in all directions that did not bother her much; she never experienced any diplopia. Eventually, she developed myalgias and fatigue. However, her main complaints were numbness and burning",1
"pain in her hands and feet that worsened over time, as well as cramps in her feet. She reported sensitivity to temperature; cold exacerbated burning pain in her feet mostly at night. She also felt clumsy; she frequently dropped things from her hands despite bilateral carpal tunnel release in the past, she had developed mild action hand tremors, and she often suffered near-falls because her balance had deteriorated over time. She was taking duloxetine 30 mg/day and pregabalin 300 mg/day with partial benefit of her burning pain, and she tried lidocaine patches on feet that did not provide any relief. She also reported a longstanding history of dysphagia to solids, with an isolated episode of aspiration in the past and episodes of retrosternal spasms during meals. She denied speech or chewing difficulties. She denied shortness of breath, hearing difficulties, cataracts, or heart problems. Her past medical history also included sleep apnea and cervical and lumbar spine surgeries. She denied alcohol or illicit drug use. Her older brother had similar ocular symptoms and carried a diagnosis of neuropathy; both of uncertain etiology too.",1
"Before the first visit with us, she had undergone several tests since the symptom onset that we have summarized here. Thus, her serum creatine kinase was mildly elevated (268 U/L, ref: 33–211) and her baseline lactate was high (=5.5 nmol/L, ref: 0.5–2.2). Blood cell count, electrolytes, vitamin B12, serum protein electrophoresis, hemoglobin A1C, thyroid-stimulating hormone, C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, carnitine and acylcarnitine levels, antinuclear antibodies, and acetylcholine receptor binding antibodies were all normal or negative. Urine organic acids were also normal. A brain CT scan did not show any intracranial abnormality. She underwent genetic testing for oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy that was negative. She had two electrodiagnostic studies; both showed a length-dependent, axonal, and sensory polyneuropathy (sensory nerve action potentials of both sural nerves were absent, and sensory nerve action potentials of ulnar and radial nerves demonstrated reduced amplitudes and normal peak latencies). At the age of 59, she underwent a muscle biopsy of left quadriceps muscle that showed mild myopathic and neuropathic features; the former included occasional subsarcolemmal accumulation of mitochondria and scattered COX-negative muscle fibers, while the latter; angulated fibers, nuclear clumps, and mild fiber type grouping that were attributed to her history of lumbosacral radiculopathy (Figure 1). Although such mild mitochondrial findings within the sixth decade of life could be a consequence of normal aging, a manifestation of a mitochondrial disorder was also plausible. Sequencing of mtDNA from muscle tissue did not detect any point mutation or deletions. Furthermore, mitochondrial carnitine and CoQ10 levels, and activity of electron transport chain complexes were all normal from the biopsied muscle tissue. Although no definitive diagnosis was reached at that time, a mitochondrial disorder was still favored and she was started on L-carnitine, creatine, and CoQ10 for that reason.",1
"At initial evaluation with us, approximately 15 years after symptom onset, her exam revealed normal fundoscopic evaluation, normal pupils that were bilaterally reactive to light, symmetric and severe impairment of extraocular motility in all",1
"directions of gaze without misalignment, and moderate bilateral ptosis despite past surgical corrections. She did not have facial weakness, her hearing was normal to conversation, and the rest of the cranial nerves were intact. Her muscle strength, bulk, and tone were normal. There were no myotonia or fasciculations. Deep tendon reflexes were 2+ at biceps, brachioradialis, and triceps, and were bilaterally absent at patella and ankles. Plantar responses were flexor. Temperature and pin sensations were severely reduced in feet and hands, proprioception was impaired at great toes, the vibratory sensation was abolished at great toes and malleoli, and Romberg test was positive. There was no dysmetria on finger-to-nose or heel-to-shin tests. She had a mild wide-based gait; she was unable to walk in tandem but able to walk on heels and toes.",1
"An autosomal recessive CPEO plus syndrome, involving the peripheral nerve, was then suspected. The coexistence of polyneuropathy prompted us to investigate nuclear DNA defects that might be causing secondary defects of mtDNA despite no alterations in mtDNA sequencing from the biopsied muscle, which might be explained by heteroplasmy, sampling bias, or lack of significant involvement of skeletal muscle in her case. More specifically, the presence of neuropathic pain pointed to consider a POLG-related disease as a possibility; whereas most “mitochondrial neuropathies” are painless, neuropathic pain appears to be more common in patients who have POLG mutations (7, 8). Genetic testing of POLG gene revealed a known compound of heterozygous mutations: one that comprises two single nucleotides in-cis (c.752 C>T and c.1760 C>T, which lead to p.Thr251Ile and p.Pro587Leu, respectively) and another one in-trans (c.1399G>A, p.Ala467Thr); these findings confirmed a POLG-related disease as unifying diagnosis.",1
DISCUSSION,0
"Here, we present a patient with painless, progressive, bilateral, adult-onset ptosis and ophthalmoparesis, who also developed symptoms suggestive of peripheral nerve (polyneuropathy and neuropathic pain) and skeletal muscle (myalgias) involvement. This multi-organ phenotype suggested a mitochondrial disorder. An elevated serum lactic acid at baseline increased the diagnostic suspicion for a mitochondrial disorder. Although the presence of occasional subsarcolemmal mitochondrial accumulation and scattered COX-negative fibers on muscle biopsy could be agingrelated findings in her case, a manifestation of a mitochondrial disorder could not be ruled out. However, the sequencing of mtDNA from biopsied muscle tissue was normal. In an affected organ (such as skeletal muscle), one would expect a single mtDNA deletion or point mutations of mtDNA in primary mitochondrial disorders, and multiple mtDNA deletions or mtDNA depletion in secondary mitochondrial disorders due to nuclear genetic defects. We suspected that the normal result of mtDNA sequencing from biopsied muscle and the nonspecific and mild pathological findings contributed to delay in diagnosis in this case. However, although sequencing of mtDNA may identify deletions and point mutations, it may miss mtDNA depletion (loss of mtDNA copies) that would require assessment of copy number which was not performed. It is also plausible that skeletal muscle was not affected enough to reveal abnormalities of mtDNA (low or no mutant copies of mtDNA to detect), or that muscle sampling missed mtDNA abnormalities, or a combination of both. Thus, normal mtDNA sequencing should not discourage clinicians from further investigating the possibility of a mitochondrial disorder. Furthermore, neuropathy",1
"is rare in patients with single large-scale mitochondrial deletions or mtDNA point mutations (4, 12). Similar symptoms in her brother pointed to an autosomal recessive inheritance in her case which increased our suspicion for mutations in a nuclear gene. Lastly, polyneuropathy is a predictor of nuclear genetic defects in mitochondrial disorders, and the presence TABLE 1 | Electrodiagnostic features of “mitochondrial neuropathies” associated with CPEO.

In 2001, Van Goethem et al. reported the first POLG mutations as the cause of the CPEO Single large-scale deletion of mtDNA",0
"PN, polyneuropathy. Kearns-Sayre syndrome phenotype (10). The number of POLG mutations and their associated clinical manifestations have dramatically expanded over the years (1). Identified POLG mutations in this patient (the complex p.Thr251Ile and p.Pro587Leu on one allele and p.Ala467Thr on the second allele) were previously reported in patients with CPEO or CPEO plus syndromes, and with infantile hepatocerebral syndromes (Alpers syndrome) (5, 11).",0
"This patient underwent electrodiagnostic studies twice and a muscle biopsy. An axonal or mixed sensory polyneuropathy has been reported in patients with POLG mutations, but this",0
"electrical finding is not specific (12). Table 1 summarizes the electrical pattern of polyneuropathies in mitochondrial disorders in which CPEO is a hallmark. Likewise, and in addition to mild mitochondrial pathology in muscle fibers on muscle biopsy, the presence of neurogenic changes (angulated fibers, nuclear bags, and fiber type grouping) is also common in mitochondrial disorders but with no specific, and her history of lumbosacral radiculopathy may have also accounted for them (13).",0
"Although polyneuropathy and neuropathic pain are common, a mitochondrial disorder should be considered in the presence of CPEO. Genetic testing in blood samples looking for nuclear defects should be the first step in this scenario. We would like to emphasize the importance of continuing to define and recognize clinical mitochondrial syndromes to avoid unnecessary testing and delays in diagnosis.
