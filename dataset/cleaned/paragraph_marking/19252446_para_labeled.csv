"Historically, mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders have been recognized as a multisystemic disease with predominantly neuromuscular dysfunction (1). To date, most patients with mutations in POLG have presented with predominantly neurological features of headaches or focal seizures (2,3). In 1 study, end-state hepatic disease developed in only 2 of 26 cases (2). In another study, the only patients who experienced hepatic disease had been exposed to sodium valproate (3,4). Viral infection may be temporally associated with the development of acute liver failure in pediatric patients (5). However, the majority of children who contract viral infections do not experience liver failure. This suggests that there must be host factors that differentiate those children who do experience liver failure.",0
"CASE 1 An infant girl was born at term with a normal birth weight to nonconsanguineous white parents. At 2 months of age she had feeding difficulties and hypotonia. Consequently, she underwent an extensive medical evaluation that included determination of plasma electrolytes, lactate/pyruvate, plasma amino acids, urine organic acids, chromosome karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization for DiGeorge deletion, Angelman/PraderWilli methylation studies, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. The results of these tests Received February 16, 2008; accepted March 28, 2008.",1

The authors report no conflicts of interest. 126 were normal. Although the result of her initial newborn hearing screening was normal, subsequent testing showed her auditory brainstem response to be abnormal.",0
"At 4.5 months of age the patient contracted an influenza A infection. Concurrently she experienced hepatomegaly associated with severe hypoglycemia and elevations of plasma tyrosine (203 mmol/L, normal range [NR] 35–126), glutamine (994 mmol/L, NR 353– 883), and alanine (1048 mmol/L, NR 152– 459). Her serum lactate was increased to 9.8 mmol/L (NR <2.2). The markedly increased lactate-to-pyruvate ratio (43.9, NR <15) suggested a defect in the electron transport chain or tricarboxylic acid cycle (6).",1
"Abnormalities in liver synthetic function were demonstrated by an elevated prothrombin time of 23 seconds (NR 12.4–15.1) and a partial thromboplastin time of 58 seconds (NR 25–39). Her conjugated bilirubin increased to 1.89 mg/dL (NR 0.0–0.3), suggesting a cholestatic process. Conversely, there were only modest elevations in liver hepatocellular enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] 260 U/L, NR 16–46; alanine transaminase [ALT] 313 U/L, NR 29–46) without significant elevations in creatinine kinase. Ammonia was normal until the final stages of her illness, when it rose to 76 mmol/L (normal",1
<50).,0
"Her neurological status did not show further decline. She did not experience seizures or nystagmus. However, a lumbar puncture 2 days after her second admission for worsening liver failure showed elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein (550 mg/dL, NR 15– 40) with a nearly acellular tap (13 white blood cells, 0 red blood cells). MRI of the brain showed nonspecific extraaxial fluid collection over the frontal cortex and also thickening and enhancement of the nerve roots of the cauda equina. These changes, sometimes seen in demyelinating polyneuropathies, suggested a possible neurodegenerative disorder.",1
"DE NOVO MUTATIONS IN POLG WITH LIVER FAILURE OR ENCEPHALOPATHY 127 FIG. 1. (A) Liver shows marked accumulation of lipid (microsteatosis; trichrome stain, original magnification x40). (B) Longitudinal section of skeletal muscle shows marked accumulation of subsarcolemmal neutral lipid; mitochondria are unremarkable (electron microscopy, bar equals 1 mm).",1
"The results of other studies, including lysosomal enzymes, plasma very-long-chain fatty acids, and screening for common mutations of mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (mtDNA) were normal. She showed signs of ongoing respiratory difficulty, pancreatitis, and renal tubulopathy. Despite aggressive medical therapy, the patient died at the age of 5.5 months.",1
"Liver biopsy revealed marked panlobular accumulation of neutral lipid within hepatocytes, with a predominantly microvesicular pattern (Fig. 1A). Moderate subacute portal inflammation, mild canalicular and hepatocellular cholestasis, and mild pseudoacinar formation were also noted. Glycogen staining was normal. Electron microscopy confirmed the microvesicular steatosis but did not demonstrate any structural abnormalities of mitochondria. The muscle biopsy revealed prominent accumulation of neutral lipid within myocytes, especially in the subsarcolemmal region, corresponding to a ‘‘lipid",1
"myopathy’’ (Fig. 1B). The myofibers were abnormally small, measuring from 5 to 10 mm in cross-sectional diameter. There were no ragged-red fibers or cyclooxygenase-negative fibers. Glycogen staining was normal. Electron microscopy confirmed the excessive accumulation of lipid and demonstrated small subsarcolemmal collections of mitochondria in occasional myofibers. Most mitochondria in the specimen contained matrix granules. Some cristae were slightly curved or dilated, but there were no unique structural abnormalities and no paracrystalline inclusions. The mitochondria ranged from 105 to 510 (mean 262) nm in cross-sectional diameter. Abnormally enlarged mitochondria were not present. The lipid droplets ranged from 260 to 1464 nm in diameter. The activities of liver mitochondrial enzymes, including respiratory chain complexes, are summarized in Table 1.",1
"Three heterozygous POLG mutations; c.752C>T (p.T251I), c.1760C>T (p.P587L), and c.3572A>G",1
"(p.K1191R), were identified. The p.T251I and p.P587L missense mutations have been frequently reported in cis (7–9). The novel missense variant, c.3572A>G (p.K1191R), predicts a relatively conservative change of lysine to arginine; however, a p.K1191N mutation at the same amino acid residue has been found in a patient with Alper syndrome (2). Thus, the p.K1191R alteration is likely to be pathogenic. Testing of the parents’ DNA showed that the mother was heterozygous for the p.T251I and p.P587L missense mutations, confirming her carrier status. Test results from the father were negative for all of the mutations. Paternity was confirmed by comparative analysis using 15 unlinked polymorphic markers. Measurement of the mtDNA content in liver using qPCR revealed a severely reduced mtDNA (3% of age-matched mean), consistent with 2 mutated alleles in the POLG gene.",1
"CASE 2 A white infant boy was born to healthy unrelated parents. At 18 months of age, he had speech and motor delay. He was able to crawl but not walk. MRI of the spinal cord showed an asymptomatic syrinx between T11 and L1. While at home with his family, he had a newonset seizure that included eye deviation, jaw clenching, and hypotonia of the trunk and extremities. He experienced repetitive generalized tonic-clonic seizures that evolved into refractory status epilepticus. No precipitating event or ingestion was identified, and he was not ill or febrile before the onset of seizures.",1
"Standard treatment with phenobarbital, fosphenytoin, midazolam, lorazepam, and diazepam was unsuccessful. Therefore, the child underwent pentobarbital coma for seizure control. He was not treated with valproic acid. After 30 days of this treatment, his seizures resolved and the pentobarbital was discontinued. He was left with a severe encephalopathy characterized by choreo-athetoid J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr, Vol. 49, No. 1, July 2009 128 LUTZ ET AL. TABLE 1.

"Mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activities in liver and muscle showed significantly reduced complex IþIII and IIþIII and IV in liver before and after correction for citrate synthase and significantly reduced complex IIþIII in muscle. Citrate synthase and succinate dehydrogenase activities, which are not encoded by mtDNA, were found to be increased in liver, consistent with mitochondrial proliferation.
