"This 54 year old woman presented with symptoms of sensory ataxic neuropathy, with cerebellar features. She developed further weakness, visual disturbances with diplopia, dysarthria and dysphasia. After her death at 66 years, she was found to have compound heterozygous mutations of POLG1 gene in muscle, and Southern blot showed low levels of multiple deletions of mitochondrial DNA. Neuropathological examination showed profound dorsal column and dorsal spinocerebellar tract degeneration, degeneration of dorsal root ganglia and Clarke’s nucleus in spinal cord and severe predominantly sensory peripheral neuropathy. The brain showed severe neuronal loss and gliosis in substantia nigra, medial posterior thalamus and head of caudate. Excess numbers of COX-negative ﬁbres and “ragged-red” ﬁbres were found in ﬁve skeletal muscles sampled.",1

"Mitochondrial DNA polymerase-c (POLG) is a nuclear encoded protein involved in mitochondrial DNA replication and the only DNA polymerase functional in animal mitochondria [1,2]. In humans the 195 kDa heterotrimer consists of one catalytic subunit which is encoded by POLG1 located on chromosome 15q25 and two accessory subunits encoded by POLG2 located on chromosome 17q23-24. ⇑ Corresponding author.

"E-mail address: penny.mckelvie@svhm.org.au (P. McKelvie). POLG1 has 23 exons and the ﬁrst pathogenic mutations of POLG1 were identiﬁed in the autosomal dominant syndrome chronic progressive ophthalmoplegia (adCPEO) [3]. This is characterized by multiple secondary mtDNA deletions in skeletal muscle causing cytochrome c oxidase (COX) defects. In some families transmitting dominant POLG1 mutations, a high incidence of psychiatric disease, a Parkinsonian syndrome and primary gonadal failure have also been reported [4,5].",0
"Compound heterozygous POLG1 mutations have been identiﬁed in the autosomal recessive syndromes in patients with sporadic and recessive PEO, which are also characterized by mtDNA deletions [4]. Subsequently, mutations in POLG1 were identiﬁed in patients with Alpers syndrome, ataxia neuropathy syndromes, idiopathic parkinsonism 0960-8966/$ - see front matter © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

"and others, all characterized by mtDNA deletions or depletions in symptomatic tissues [2]. (To date, about 150 disease mutations have been identiﬁed [2]. Studies have indicated that SANDO (sensory, ataxic neuropathy with dysarthria and ophthalmoparesis), is a variant of autosomal recessive progressive external ophthalmoplegia (arCPEO). In SANDO, ocular manifestions occur at a later stage of disease progression and are less prominent than the sensory ataxic neuropathy, which is distinguishable from the mild generalized sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy in CPEO patients [5–7].",0
"We present a case study showing spinal cord, peripheral nerve and selective nuclear degeneration in the brain due to recessive compound heterozygous mutations of POLG1. Case report A 54 year old woman ﬁrst presented with an eight year history of symptoms including cerebellar features with ataxia in all limbs, a moderate neuropathy with depressed and absent reﬂexes in all limbs, distal weakness and distal sensory loss of proprioception and vibration. A tentative diagnosis of hereditary spinocerebellar degeneration and peripheral neuropathy was made.",1
"Progression of symptoms since initial presentation included dysarthria, slowing with fatigability, urinary stress incontinence and diplopia leading to prism lenses. She underwent bilateral total hip replacements.",1
"Investigations included normal serum phytanic acid and lactate, negative screening for peripheral leukocyte lysosomal storage disorders in 1994. Spinocerebellar ataxia tests for SCA1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 were all negative. Friedreich’s ataxia screen was negative. Serum vitamin E was within normal limits. ECG showed P-pulmonale and an ACE inhibitor was given. An echocardiogram showed no cardiomyopathy. Sleep studies revealed moderate sleep apnoea, but the patient did not tolerate CPAP. Brain MRI in 2007 revealed mild atrophy of the superior cerebellar vermis. A swallowing assessment revealed a delayed pharyngeal phase.",1
"Subsequent examination showed reduced upward gaze, but good binocular vision on lateral gaze. Lower limb hip ﬂexion and extension were grade 4-/5 (Medical Research Council Scale) and she had signiﬁcant distal weakness. Upper limbs were normal. The patient was areﬂexic and used an electric chair for mobilization over six years.",1
"During her last admission, a general deterioration of health had occurred with increasing sacral pains, dysarthria, increased drowsiness, intermittent nausea, worsening mobility and diﬃculty coping. She became progressively drowsy, encephalopathic, and febrile. She died, aged 66 years.",1
"A family history of neuropsychiatric illness in a deceased 39 year old sister was recorded. The sister suﬀered from a “nervous breakdown” and underwent electroconvulsive therapy. She had decreased memory, mobility, lower limb wasting and weakness and decreased sensation in distal upper and lower limbs. She may have also suﬀered from dysarthria and dysphasia and was wheelchairand frame",0
bound. The sister’s muscle biopsy revealed a number of cytochrome oxidase negative ﬁbres. Genetic studies were not pursued at the time and post-mortem tissue was not available for further analysis on the patient’s sister. Histological examination Muscle biopsy in 1994 (age 52 years) showed extensive type grouping of type 1 ﬁbres with severely atrophic type 2 ﬁbres and increased sarcolemmal nuclear aggregates. Some COX-negative ﬁbres were noted. Postmortem Postmortem delay was 24 h. The general autopsy showed bilateral acute bronchopneumonia. Muscle,1
"Quadriceps, gastrocnemius, deltoid, pectoralis major, psoas, intercostal and diaphragm muscles all showed an excess number (>5%) of COX-negative ﬁbres and raggedred ﬁbres (>3%). Scattered degenerating and regenerating ﬁbres and increased numbers of sarcolemmal nuclear aggregates were noted in all muscles. Group atrophy of ﬁbres in the quadriceps muscle and marked atrophy and almost end-stage atrophy in gastrocnemius. Poor ﬁbre typing was seen with ATPase stains in all muscles except the deltoid which showed type grouping of type 1 and type 2 ﬁbres. Peripheral nerves",1
"The sural nerve showed severe loss of myelinated ﬁbres of all diameters with only some residual small diameter ﬁbres (Fig. 1a). Electron microscopy revealed small numbers of thinly myelinated axons, some axonal atrophy, scattered clusters of regenerating ﬁbres but no onion bulbs or Wallerian degeneration. Femoral nerve showed mild loss Fig. 1. (a) Sural nerve stained with osmium tetroxide showing very few residual myelinated axons. Magniﬁcation x200. P.

"of myelinated ﬁbres, especially larger diameter ﬁbres. Electron microscopy showed similar changes to those in sural nerve but less severe. Brain",0
"There was prominent loss of pigmented neurons in the substantia nigra bilaterally (Fig. 2) with no Lewy bodies or neuroﬁbrillary tangles and negative immunohistochemistry for Tau, ubiquitin and alpha-synuclein. Mild neuronal loss and gliosis was noted in the vestibular nuclei. There was severe neuronal loss and gliosis in the ventrolateral posterior nuclei of the thalamus. Neuronal loss and atrophy was seen in the head of the caudate nucleus without overt infarction. There was minimal loss of the Purkinje cells in the superior cerebellar vermis. Dentate nucleus and cerebellum were otherwise normal.",1
Spinal cord,0
"There was prominent atrophy of the gracile and cuneate nuclei, posterior columns at all levels and the dorsal spinocerebellar tract with very atrophic dorsal nerve roots (Figs. 3a and 3b). Luxol fast blue and neuroﬁlament stains conﬁrmed that there was both severe axonal and myelin loss in the dorsal columns. Clarke’s nucleus showed moderate depletion of large neurons and reduced size and numbers of residual neurons. Dorsal root ganglia showed degeneration with loss of neurons with residual islands of satellite cells and a number of degenerating and atrophic neurons (Fig. 3c). The anterior nerve roots also appeared mildly atrophic with some loss of neurons in the anterior horns in lumbar cord.",1

"The common point mutations for MELAS (MTTL1m.3243A>G), MERRF (MT-TK m.8344A>G), LHON (MT-ND1m.3460A>G and m.11778G>A) were not detected in the primary muscle biopsy. A Southern blot showed no mtDNA deletions on the primary muscle biopsy. Screening for the common point mutation for NARP/ LS MT-ATP6m.8993T>C/G on blood DNA from a Guthrie card was negative. The tests for spinocerebellar ataxia, SCA 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 showed normal results. Friedreich’s ataxia screen and the peripheral leucocyte lysosomal storage disorder screen were also negative. Postmortem genetic studies",0
"A mitochondrial mutation screen was again carried out on postmortem deltoid muscle. The common point mutations for MELAS (MT-TL1m.3243A>G), MERRF (MTTK m.8344A>G), NARP/LS (MT-ATP6m.8993T>C/G) and LHON (MT-ND1m.3460A>G, m.11778G>A and m.14484T>C) were not detected in the muscle biopsy. The rarer mutations for MELAS (MT-TL1m.3271T>C and MT-ND5m.13513G>A) were also not detected. Sequencing of the mitochondrialencoded COX I, II and III genes only revealed reported polymorphisms not associated with pathogenicity.",0
"A Southern blot on postmortem psoas, pectoralis, intercostal, gastrocnemius, diaphragm, deltoid and quadriceps muscles revealed low levels of multiple mtDNA deletions. Analysis of quadriceps muscle DNA by qPCR revealed a decreased amount of mtDNA in relative to nuclear DNA, corresponding to 28% and 32% of the normal mean ratio in two independent experiments.",0
"Sequencing of POLG (http://www.tools.niehs.nih.gov/ polg/) exons in genomic DNA did not detect the 3 common pathogenic variants of European origin p.A467T, p.W748S and p.G848S. However, two reported heterozygous sequence variants in the polymerase domain of POLG1 were identiﬁed. The ﬁrst was a heterozygous mutation c.2584G>A in exon 16 predicting a p.A862T change. The second heterozygous mutation was in exon 3, a c.830A>T predicting a p.H277L change. The A 862 nucleotide and the 277 amino acid, histidine, are highly conserved from humans to neurospora. Genetic studies in family members",1
Further studies were carried out on two other siblings and the daughter with no manifestation of disease. Only the c.830A>T mutation was found in heterozygous form in the patient’s 36 year old daughter and the patient’s 72 year old sister. The two variants described in the patient were not detected in the second sibling of 80 years of age. Discussion,0
"This woman presented in middle age with a progressive sensory ataxic neuropathy with later development of ptosis, dysarthria, dysphagia and external ophthalmoparesis. No deﬁnite diagnosis was made prior to autopsy but a form of hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia with peripheral neuropathy was favoured. Mitochondrial cytopathy was suspected in view of the previous changes of “ragged-red” ﬁbres and cytochrome oxidase-negative ﬁbres on two muscle biopsies performed 20 and 14 years prior to death.",1
"Autopsy conﬁrmed that the patient had multiple mtDNA deletions associated with compound heterozygous POLG mutations (p.A862T and p.H277L) in skeletal muscle. The p.A862T mutation has been reported previously as a compound heterozygous mutation in a man with late onset PEO and ataxia with a SCA-like illness in siblings [8]. The p.H277L mutation has only been very recently reported as a compound heterozygous mutation in a man with late onset PEO and parkinsonism [9]. Detailed neuropathological examination in our case conﬁrmed features of mitochondrial myopathy in multiple skeletal muscles, severe predominantly sensory peripheral neuropathy, but also profound dorsal column and dorsal spinocerebellar tract degeneration in the spinal cord, which has not previously been reported in patients with documented POLG mutations or SANDO. Dorsal root ganglion cells were reduced in number and size with evidence of dropout and ongoing degeneration. Clarke’s nucleus also showed loss of large neurons and reduced size and numbers of residual neurons. However, spinal cord involvement (dorsal column and dorsal spinocerebellar tract degeneration) has been noted in patients with mitochondrial cytopathy with ataxic neuropathy and PEO [10]. Another adult case with multiple mtDNA deletions, published prior to the identiﬁcation of POLG [3], but who is likely to have POLG mutation(s) and the clinical scenario of ataxia, PEO, ptosis, peripheral neuropathy, dysphagia and extrapyramidal movement disorder also had dorsal column and dorsal root ganglia degeneration at autopsy [11]. Posterior column degeneration has been reported in a family with a rare autosomal dominant POLG1 mutation with metabolic strokes and multiendocrine disease [12].",1
