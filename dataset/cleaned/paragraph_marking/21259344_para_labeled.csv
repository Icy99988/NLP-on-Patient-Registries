"Here, for the ﬁrst time, we describe a patient who presented with clinical and radiological ﬁndings suggestive of multiple system atrophy (MSA) of the cerebellar subtype (MSA-C), but was shown to have mutations of POLG1. This case highlights the importance of considering primary mitochondrial disorders in the differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes.3,4 Case Report Written informed consent was obtained from the patient to publish both video and brain imaging results for this case report. This 58-year-old woman had a progressive cerebellar syndrome. Her symptoms had started",1
"9 years prior, with imbalance when getting out of a canoe or when walking up and down stairs. She also noted poor handwriting and mild incoordination of the hands. Her speech had become slurred. Her symptoms worsened toward the end of the day or when she was fatigued. In addition, the symptoms partially improved after excluding dietary gluten and she had lost 18 kg over the previous year. She had mild urinary incontinence when coughing. She has type II diabetes mellitus, treated with Pioglitazone. There is no history of epilepsy, cognitive problems, visual problems, stroke-like episodes, hearing problems, or menstrual disturbances. Her family history revealed that she had a sister who died at 2 years of age. This child, who was blind, was never able to roll, sit, or walk independently, and she also had intractable seizures. No diagnosis was ever established. The proband’s brother has sensorineural hearing loss, glaucoma, and adult-onset diabetes mellitus requiring treatment with insulin.",1
"On initial examination, 4 years after the onset of her symptoms, she had slight slowing of vertical saccades but a full range of eye movements and normal fundi. She had dysarthria, mild limb dysmetria that was worse on the left, mild slowing of foot taps bilaterally, and a mildly impaired tandem gait; tone and reﬂexes were normal with ﬂexor plantar responses (see Supporting Information video). Investigations for coeliac",1
"Mitochondrial disorders can result from either primary defects in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or defects in nuclear encoded proteins that affect mtDNA structure or function. The maintenance of mtDNA replication is critically dependent upon mtDNA polymerase-c,1 encoded by the nuclear genes POLG1 and POLG2. Mutations in POLG1 have been described in ------------------------------------------------------------ Additional Supporting Information may be found in the online version of this article.",0

"disease, including a small bowel biopsy, were negative. Sensory testing was normal and nerve conduction studies were normal. In view of the signiﬁcant weight loss, investigations for a paraneoplastic process were performed and the anti-Purkinje cell antibody was negative. Computed tomography of thorax and mammogram were normal. Her Vitamin B12 and E levels were normal. Metabolic studies, including plasma amino acids, urine organic acids, carnitine proﬁle, lactate, ammonia, and leukocyte hexosaminidase A activity, were all normal. Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 testing were negative. She was found to have an intermediate-range expansion of the CTG repeat of the SCA type 8 (SCA-8) gene, with allele sizes of 75 and 26 CTG repeats, which were not felt to be clinically signiﬁcant. Her magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan showed pontine and cerebellar atrophy with some T2 hyperintensities in the middle cerebellar peduncles (Fig.1).",1
"Her symptoms continued to progress and 7 years after symptom onset her dysarthria and cerebellar ataxia had signiﬁcantly worsened. Despite using a walker, she fell and sustained a right hip fracture. She developed postural dizziness owing to orthostatic hypotension. Moreover, her urinary urgency worsened and she developed nocturia. She had drooling of saliva and intermittent dysphagia for liquids. Examination revealed a supine blood pressure of 110/60 and 90/40 mm Hg after standing for 3 minutes, with no corresponding change in pulse rate. She had polyminimyoclonus of her outstretched hands, a positive glabellar tap and brisk deep tendon reﬂexes with ﬂexor plantar responses. She was unable to walk unaided and required a wheelchair. On recent examination (9 years after onset), she had jerky saccades, marked dysarthria,",1
