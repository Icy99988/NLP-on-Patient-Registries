"Parkinsonism with1,2 or without3 chronic progressive ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) can be caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA polymerase g (POLG). POLG-associated Parkinsonism (POLG-P) is at least partially responsive to levodopa,1,2 but predictors of dopamine-response have not been reported. Of the plethora of different syndromes associated with POLG-mutations, depression and anxiety present common major therapeutic problems.4 Patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (IPD) frequently show improvement not only of motor symptoms but also of depression and anxiety after initiation of treatment with levodopa or dopamine agonists. Here, we present a patient with POLG-P whose Parkinsonism and depression showed sustained excellent response to dopaminergic treatment.",1
"A 55-year-old woman of Croatian origin presented with a 3-year history of slowly progressive facial masking, hypophonia, symmetric cogwheeling of the wrists, shufﬂing gait, marked bradykinesia, and positive pull test, yielding 47/108 points in the UPDRS motor score. Bilateral ptosis, incomplete CPEO, and exercise intolerance had been present for 10 years and had led to the previous misdiagnosis of myasthenia gravis. Severe depression, indicated by 43/63 points on the Beck Depression Inventory, had been noted for 3 years. Family history on the paternal side was positive for CPEO and ptosis, and both sons of the patient, aged 28 and 25 years, were suffering from ptosis, depression, and anxiety but had no extrapyramidal movement abnormalities. Two consecutive subcutaneous injections of apomorphine markedly reduced UPDRS motor scores from 47 to 27 points (243%) on 2.5 mg apomorphine and from 55 to 26 points",1
(253%) on 5 mg apomorphine (Supporting Table 1). The injections also lead to a rapid and marked amelioration of depressed mood. A long-term medication was initiated with extended release formulations of ropinirole (6 mg/d) and levodopa (100 mg/d).,0
"At 10 months follow-up, the patient presented with a sustained improvement of Parkinsonism and mood as evidenced by a decrease down to 20 points in the UPDRS motor score (257%) and to 4 points on the Beck Depression Inventory (291%) (Testing was done by an examiner blind to the results of the apomorphine tests; for details see Supporting Tables 1 and 2).

"123I-FP-CIT-DATScan demonstrated a severe symmetric reduction of nigrostriatal dopamine transporters similar to advanced IPD (Fig. 1B) and ruled out a depression-induced ‘‘pseudo-Parkinsonism.’’ In addition, transcranial sonography (performed by an examiner blind to the history and clinical examination of the patient) revealed a hyperechogenic substantia nigra and a hypoechogenic raphe (Fig 1D), thus resembling the characteristic sonography midbrain ﬁndings of IPD with depression.5 Because of the suggestive phenotype and family history, a genetic analysis of the POLG gene was initiated, revealing a heterozygous Tyr955Cys mutation, which is known to present, interalia, as POLG-P with autosomal dominant inheritance.1",1
"Our ﬁndings present close similarities between IPD and POLG-P: in contrast to other atypical Parkinson diseases like MSA-P or PSP-P, both entities feature predominant degeneration of nigro-striatal dopaminergic neurons, respond well not only to levodopa but also to dopamine agonists and display hyperechogenicity of the substantia nigra.",0
"These similarities are particularly interesting as increased levels of mtDNA deletion and respiratory chain deﬁciency have been found in substantia nigra neurons of IPD patients,6 thus suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction as part of the complex pathogenetic pathway of substantia nigra degeneration in IPD. As POLG mutations lead to elevated levels of oxidative stress and mtDNA damage,7 patients harboring these mutations might be at particular risk for IPD-like substantia nigra degeneration.",0
"Antidepressant effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists, especially of D4/D5 agonists like ropinirole, have been shown consistently in patients with IPD.8 Almost complete remission of depression in our patient might be partially attributed to her dramatic motor improvement but it is likely that speciﬁc dopaminergic effects like in IPD are also involved. Future studies are warranted to test whether depression in POLG-patients without Parkinsonism is also associated with a hypoechogenic raphe and responds to dopaminergic treatment as well.",0
"In conclusion, the large beneﬁt from dopaminergic therapy emphasizes the need to identify motor and nonmotor parkinsonian features also in the large majority of those POLGpatients that present with a multifaceted phenotype. Moreover, differentiating POLG-P from other forms of atypical Parkinsonism is of great importance because of the potential excellent response to dopaminergic medication. Transcranial sonography and apopmorphine testing could serve as inexpensive, easily available tests for facilitating a differential diagnosis and to predict treatment response of both motor and nonmotor symptoms.",0

"Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN [MIM 234200]) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with iron accumulation in the basal ganglia, due to mutations in the pantothenate kinase 2 (PANK2) gene on chromosome 20p13.1 The phenotype of PKAN is widely variable and overlaps with a wide spectrum of disorders characterized by neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation, formerly known as Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome.2",0
"A 55-year-old Korean man visited our movement disorder clinic due to tremulous movement in the right arm and hand. He was healthy until his late thirties, but he felt unpleasant movements on the right hand while doing ﬁne actions, and then he had slowly progressive difﬁculty in writing and manipulation with right hand for 7 years. There was no history of drug exposure, trauma or other medical problems, but family history was positive for his brother, who had similar symptoms. Initial neurological examination revealed the postural and kinetic tremulous movements in the right arm and hand (video, segment 1). He had no problem in the left upper and both lower extremities, and his gait and balance were normal. There was no other focal neurologic sign. He did not have any cognitive or psychiatric problems like depression or obsessive–compulsive disorder. The score of minimental sta-",0
tus examination was 30.,0
"Initial routine blood tests including thyroid and parathyroid hormone test, peripheral blood smear test, and gene studies for Huntington‘s disease and torsion dystonia (DYT1 gene) were not remarkable. Cervical spine magnetic resonance images (MRI) was normal. Brain T2-weighted ﬂuid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI showed symmetrical low signal intensity in the pallidum with a slight anteromedial core of high signal intensity, as the so-called ‘‘eye-ofthe-tiger’’ sign (Fig. 1A). Although he had unilateral symptoms in the right upper extremity, there was no difference in size and intensity between bilateral brain lesions. Furthermore, brain perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed no signiﬁcant perfusion asymmetry in this patient (Fig. 1B).",0
"Genetic studies of the PANK2 gene (GenBank ID: NM_153638.2) examined by DNA sequence analyses revealed the two heterozygous mutations. One mutation was 1-bp nucleotide deletion of C and insertion of TT in exon 3 (c.1153delCinsTT), resulting in frame shift and generation of a premature stop codon (p.Leu385PhefsX11; Fig. 2A). Another mutation was a single nucleotide substitution (c.1319G>C) in exon 4, which was predicted to replace arginine residue at codon 440 with proline (p.Arg440Pro; Fig. 2B).

During medical treatment, his disability had been in stationary state over the following 3 years and was restricted to his right arm and hand.",0
"For now, we report a Korean patient with PKAN presenting atypical phenotype that included late-onset, levodopa-responsive dystonic tremor in the mainly unilateral upper extremity, and identiﬁed two novel compound heterozygous mutations in exon 3 (Leu385PhefsX11) and exon 4 (Arg440Pro) of the PANK2 gene. To our knowledge, these two mutations have not been reported previously. Although we recommended further genetic study for his brother with similar neurologic symptoms and other asymptomatic family members, they denied the further genetic studies.",0
"To date, numerous mutations underlying PKAN have been reported; patients with nonsense mutations show typical phenotype while those with missense mutations tend to show atypical clinical manifestations.2–4 In one latest report about atypical PKAN, there are many differences of phenotype between two siblings with same genotype.5",0
"Similar to our patient, some reports about PKAN have presented focal or unilateral phenotype at early stage. However, many of those cases had progressed within several years, and then eventually had been aggravated, presenting multi-focal variable motor symptoms.6–8 These clinical courses are different from that of our patient, whose disability had been in stationary state over 7 years and was steadily restricted to his right arm and hand. Interestingly, our case showed an unilateral dystonic tremor even though his brain MRI revealed symmetrical ‘‘eye-of-the-tiger’’ sign in the basal ganglia. Furthermore, in contrast with our expectation, his brain perfusion SPECT showed no signiﬁcant perfusion asymmetry.",0

"Camptocormia, also called bent spine syndrome, is an extreme ﬂexion of the trunk during walking that resolves in the supine position. Treatment attempts for this disabling condition are often unsuccessful. We describe a case of markedly improved camptocormia with the simple intervention of wearing a backpack.",0
"A 69-year-old man with Parkinson’s disease (PD) presented with progressive camptocormia for the prior 1.5 years. He had been diagnosed with PD 5 years earlier after the onset of left upper extremity resting tremor, shoulder pain, and bradykinesia. He had no discomfort when seated or supine, but with walking, he developed dramatic thoracolumbar ﬂexion associated with pain in the lower abdomen and back. The camptocormia was worse in the evenings; he reported ﬂexion approaching 908 at night compared with only slight ﬂexion in the mornings. The severity of camptocormia was unrelated to PD medication dosing, although his other PD motor symptoms responded well to dopaminergic therapy. It was exacerbated by carrying weight in front of him. It was alleviated by using a walker and with pressure on his lower back, a possible sensory trick. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was unremarkable and MRIs of thoracic and lumbar spine were notable for mild degenerative changes. Botulinum toxin A injections to the rectus abdominis muscles ﬁrst with 180 units and later with 360 units were ineffective. Muscle relaxants were also ineffective. Additional levodopa improved his PD symptoms and produced mild dyskinesias but did not improve the camptocormia.",0

"Neurologic exam, performed while PD medications were active, revealed normal muscle tone throughout, mild asymmetric bradykinesia, absence of tremor, and mild choreiform dyskinesias. He had mild age-appropriate thoracic kyphosis while seated and standing, but otherwise no abnormal anterior or lateral ﬂexion. He was examined in the morning, a time when he reported his truncal ﬂexion was relatively mild. After walking for about 30 s, he had onset of thoracolumbar ﬂexion that progressed for another 30 s to reach a maximum of ,408. This degree of ﬂexion was intolerably painful, caused him to stop walking and forced his trunk upright. He would then resume walking and the pattern would repeat. The rectus abdominis muscles were palpably tight during ﬂexion. The camptocormia was completely relieved when wearing a low-slung backpack weighing ,6 kg (video) and returned upon removal. It was also improved by using a wheeled walker or by pressing his back against the hallway handrail. He found the backpack less cumbersome and embarrassing than using a walker.",0
"In follow-up clinic visits, he reported a consistent immediate beneﬁt each time a backpack was worn. The beneﬁt was sustained, without decrement, for long durations (hours) and was terminated only by removal of the backpack. However, prolonged use of a backpack was limited by discomfort from the backpack itself. Changing to a smaller size backpack, titrating the weight it contained, and adjusting it to hang lower partially alleviated this discomfort.",0
"Camptocormia is associated with heterogeneous etiologies including parkinsonism, primary and secondary dystonias, spinal deformities, neuromuscular disorders, psychogenic causes, and others.1 Among PD patients, camptocormia has a reported prevalence of 7%2 and is associated with greater discomfort and disability.3 It has features of a truncal kinesogenic dystonia. Many patients have palpable contraction of the rectus abdominis, improvement with sensory tricks, and a diurnal pattern of exacerbation.1,4 Like other axial manifestations of PD, it responds poorly to levodopa.1,4 Other treatments including muscle-relaxants, botulinum toxin, and deep brain stimulation have been attempted but are unsatisfactory in many cases.1,5 Thoracolumbar orthoses have been tried but some are poorly tolerated and others, while beneﬁcial, require custom design and inpatient rehabilitation training.6",0
"We speculate that the backpack may have acted as a counterweight to help correct posture as well as stimulated a sensory trick. To our knowledge, backpack therapy has not previously been reported in camptocormia, and we suggest it as an inexpensive, noninvasive option for this disabling condition. Legends to the Video",0
"Segment 1. The patient is shown walking down a hallway with camptocormia building up gradually over about 60 s. A backpack is then worn, which resolves the camptocormia. The camptocormia is also relieved when using a walker or when standing with his back against a handrail. Thoracolumbar ﬂexion is absent when supine on the examination table.

"A 57-year-old woman had a 1-year history of tremor affecting her arms, legs, trunk, and head with increasing disability in the last 5 months. Her tremor was present at rest, in the maintenance of posture and on standing. Secondary causes of tremor were excluded. There was no familial history of neurological disorders. When she was ﬁrst admitted to our clinic, her neurological examination showed head and trunk tremor along with a moderate resting and postural tremor in the four limbs, predominant on the right side, and severe legs tremor during standing. Electrophysiological studies revealed involvement of agonist-antagonist distal muscles of upper and lower limbs at a frequency of 4 to 5 Hz, at rest and in the maintenance of posture (Fig. 1A) On standing, a rhythmic legs tremor at a frequency of 5 Hz, synchronous in proximal muscles and asynchronous in distal muscles was recorded (Fig. 1C). MRI scan of the brain was normal. [123I]- FP-CIT SPECT revealed integrity of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system. The patient had received various treatments (clonazepam, propranolol, primidone, etc.) in adequate dosage but these did not result in any signiﬁcant improvement. She complained of increased disability for daily life activities and was assessed for surgery. At the clinical follow-up (18 months after baseline evaluation), the patient showed asymmetric postural and resting tremor of the upper and lower limbs, and marked tremor of the trunk and lower limbs on standing position. A second [123I]-FP-CIT SPECT performed 18 months after the ﬁrst examination was normal. Both preand post-operatively Fahn–Tolosa–Marin Tremor Rating Scale was performed (see Table 1). After written consent was obtained, she underwent monopolar bilateral microelectrode guided Vim-DBS after the usual preoperative CT-MRI localization of the target coordinate. The Vim coordinates were 4 mm posterior to the mid commissural point, 3 mm above, and 13 mm lateral to the commissural plane with active contacts 1 and 5. The patient remained conscious. The DBS setting had a frequency of 130 Hz, a pulse width of 250 ls, and a amplitude of 1 mA.",0
"Post-operatively, the beneﬁt was rapidly evident with marked improvement of tremor of head, trunk, and limbs. Comparison of preand post-operative video segments depicts the improvement quite clearly. In on-stimulation condition, resting and postural tremor completely disappeared in distal muscles of upper and lower limbs (Fig. 1B). On standing, only an asynchronous tremor was recorded in the distal muscles of the legs with substantially (more than 50% of baseline) decreased amplitude (Fig. 1D). At the follow-up visit, 12 months after surgery, DBS was still effective and the patient showed no tremor in her four limbs, trunk, and head. Her quality of life substantially improved and she remained off medication.",0
