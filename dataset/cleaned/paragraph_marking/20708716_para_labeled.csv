"Array CGH Intragenic deletion Alpers syndrome a b s t r a c t Mutations in the polymerase γ (POLG) gene are among the most common causes of mitochondrial disease and more than 160 POLG mutations have been reported. However, a large proportion of patients suspected of having POLG mutations only have one (heterozygous) deﬁnitive pathogenic mutation identiﬁed. Using oligonucleotide array CGH, we identiﬁed a compound heterozygous large intragenic deletion encompassing exons 15–21 of this gene in a child with Alpers syndrome due to mtDNA depletion. This is the ﬁrst large POLG",1

DNA polymerase γ (POLG) encoded by the nuclear POLG gene (MIM# 174763) is the only known DNA polymerase in human mitochondria. It possesses both polymerase and 3′–5′ exonuclease activities and is essential for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication and repair. More than 160 coding variations in this gene have been identiﬁed since its identiﬁcation as a disease gene in 2001 (http:// www.tools.niehs.nih.gov/polg/). Mutations in this gene cause sec-,0
"ondary defects in mtDNA maintenance leading to respiratory chain dysfunction. The current diagnostic sequencing techniques only allow the detection of point mutations, small deletions or duplications, and several reports have commented on identifying only a single heterozygous autosomal recessive POLG mutation in multiple suspected POLG patients (Agostino et al., 2003; Blok et al., 2009; Filosto et al., 2003; Wong et al., 2008b).",0
"Here we describe a patient with a common POLG disease presentation, Alpers syndrome (MIM# 203700), characterized by early age of onset, fatal intractable seizures, hepatic failure and global neurological deterioration (Naviaux and Nguyen, 2004).

"compound heterozygous for the common p.A467T POLG mutation and a novel large intragenic deletion of ~ 4.7 kb length. To our knowledge this is the ﬁrst reported case of a large deletion in POLG, illustrating the necessity of testing for intragenic deletions in all patients with a single heterozygous mutation identiﬁed. Methods Respiratory chain enzyme and mtDNA analysis",1
"Respiratory chain enzyme activities and relative abundance of mtDNA were assayed as described previously (Kirby et al., 1999; Pagnamenta et al., 2006). All enzyme and molecular investigations were performed as part of the diagnostic investigations for this patient with informed consent from the parents and in compliance with ethics approval by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne. Mutation analysis",0
"Mutation analysis was performed on genomic DNA using primers designed to amplify the coding exons and the exon–intron boundaries of POLG (NM_002693.2), DGUOK (NM_080916.1 and NM_080918.1), MPV17 (NM_002437.4) and C10orf2 (PEO1/TWINKLE) (NM_021830). 1567-7249/$ – see front matter © 2010 Elsevier B.V. and Mitochondria Research Society.

Compton et al. / Mitochondrion 11 (2011) 104–107 105 Fragments were analysed by direct sequencing using ABI 3130XL (Applied Biosystems, Melbourne, VIC Australia). RNA analysis",0
"Primary ﬁbroblasts were cultured in media with or without 100 ng/μL cycloheximide (CHX) for 24 h prior to preparation of RNA in order to minimize nonsense mediated decay (Lamande et al., 1998) before total RNA was extracted using Illustra RNAspin Mini kit (GE Healthcare, Rydalmere, NSW Australia). PCR primers were designed to amplify the entire cDNA in one or two fragments. Analysis of deletion and breakpoints",0
"A custom designed clinical oligonucleotide Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) array with complete coverage of the mitochondrial genome and about 160 nuclear genes related to mitochondrial functions and metabolic diseases, including the POLG gene (Chinault et al., 2009; Wong et al., 2008a) was manufactured using the Agilent microarray platform (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Analysis of the deletion breakpoints was performed by PCR of the deletion junction detected by array CGH. Results Case report",0
"This patient was the ﬁrst child of non-consanguineous Caucasian parents. Her birth and perinatal history were unremarkable. She presented at 12 months of age with acute partial motor status epilepticus. Initial tests demonstrated mildly abnormal liver function tests and normal blood lactate. An MRI performed 10 h after the event demonstrated a focal area of restricted diffusion with overlying subtle gyral swelling in the right occipital lobe. Acutely the EEG demonstrated almost continuous paroxysmal lateralizing epileptiform discharges over the right hemisphere. She remained encephalopathic for 24 h. On day 3 she had a further episode of focal status, despite a therapeutic level of phenytoin. Seizures continued after phenobarbitone loading and she was commenced on a midazolam infusion. Her seizures settled and she was discharged home on phenobarbitone after a 2½week admission.",1
"The patient had further admissions between 18 and 36 months, with repeated MRI showing progressively more extensive right sided diffusion changes involving the right occipital and parietal lobes plus the right posterior thalamus. At 2 years, the patient was admitted with left sided epilepsia partialis continua, which was resistant to multiple",1
"Fig. 1. Genomic DNA deletion analyses. A. Oligonucleotide array CGH analysis identiﬁed a heterozygous loss of ~ 4.5 kb (nucleotide position 87,662,154 to 87,666,650) in the long arm of chromosome 15, spanning from intron 14 to intron 21 of the POLG gene in the patient. Each dot indicates an oligonucleotide probe. Green dots represent copy number loss. The deletion region is boxed and the numbers are the coordinates of the estimated break points according to the reference sequence in the Ensembl database (ENSG00000140521 in version 54). Black dots represent no copy number changes and the red dots represent gain of copy number. The corresponding genomic structure of the POLG gene is on the right. B: Long-range PCR analysis of the POLG gene using primers located in introns 13 and 22 showed that a full-length product (5675 bp) could be detected in the father (F), mother (M)",0
"and patient (P), however a deletion product of 935 bp was also detected in a heterozygous state in both the patient and her mother (primers: forward 5′-gcaggtactcacgttggttc-3′ and reverse 5′-ctgttctccaagacccactt-3′).

"medications including topiramate, levetiracetam and clobazam, a ketogenic diet, zonisamide and a mitochondrial cocktail and no new developmental milestones were gained over the next 12 months. Liver function tests indicated a progressive hepatopathy from age 2 year 10 months. At 36 months, she had a catastrophic deterioration and was found unresponsive with right arm tonic–clonic jerking and right leg",1
"stiffness. MRI brain and EEG demonstrated new extensive left hemispheric involvement. Further neurological deterioration continued; her seizures were intractable, she required tube feeding, and was cortically blind. She died at age 3 years 6 months. Mitochondrial enzyme and molecular studies",1
"Liver respiratory chain enzymes showed Complex I deﬁciency (16% of normal control mean relative to Complex II) with an overall proﬁle suggestive of mtDNA depletion, which was conﬁrmed by qPCR (8% of the mean normal control amount of mtDNA relative to nuclear DNA). Residual enzyme activities relative to protein were 53% Complex I, 330% Complex II, 117% Complex III, 110% Complex IV and 221% citrate synthase.",1
"Sequence analysis of genomic DNA for the three most common pathogenic POLG mutations in the Australian population (Hakonen et al., 2007) identiﬁed a heterozygous p.A467T (c.1399GNA) mutation. Full POLG sequencing did not reveal any other mutations. Other genes associated with hepatic mtDNA depletion, MPV17, C10orf2 and DGUOK were also sequenced. No potentially pathogenic mutations were found in MPV17 or C10orf2. However, a heterozygous c.509ANG (p.Q170R) sequence variant was identiﬁed in DGUOK. This variant had been reported previously in a patient with hepatic mtDNA depletion (Freisinger et al., 2006) but is now regarded as a polymorphism. Sequence analysis of parental DNA demonstrated that her father carried both the POLG p.A467T mutation and the DGUOK sequence variant, making digenic inheritance unlikely. cDNA sequencing of exons 5 to 8 of POLG (from ﬁbroblasts grown±CHX) showed the presence of the heterozygous c.1399GNA POLG mutation, indicating that both alleles are expressed and that nonsense mediated mRNA decay was not occurring. Array CGH analysis on patient lymphocyte DNA revealed a heterozygous loss of approximately 4.5 kb (nucleotide positions",1
