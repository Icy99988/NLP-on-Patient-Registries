"Diseases due to mutations of polymerase c (POLG) usually present with progressive external ophthalmoplegia. However, a few studies have been reported on POLG1 mutations with the mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE)-like phenotype. All cases with POLG1 mutations mimicking MNGIE have never shown leukoencephalopathy on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or demyelinating polyneuropathy.",0
"We present a 26-year-old male with gait disturbance, recurrent bowel obstruction, peripheral neuropathy, ophthalmoplegia or ptosis, which represented MNGIE phenotype. Though he displayed demyelinating peripheral neuropathy or leukoencephalopathy on brain MRI, genetic analysis revealed heterozygous mutation in POLG1 gene.

"Mutations in Polymerase c (POLG), one of the causative genetic abnormalities of mitochondrial disease, are generally present in patients with familial progressive external ophthalmoplegia. Some patients with this gene abnormality show a phenotype that consists of severe gastrointestinal manifestations including recurrent vomiting and intestinal pseudo-obstruction, which is similar to mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) due to mutations in the gene encoding thymidine phosphorylase (TP) [1]. MNGIE usually shows demyelinating peripheral neuropathy, leukoencephalopathy, ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, and cachexia. However, all cases with POLG mutations that mimic the MNGIE phenotype so far lack leukoencephalopathy on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or demyelinating polyneuropathy [2–4]. We report two newly detected characteristics in our patient that have not been reported in patients with POLG mutations with the MNGIE-like phenotype: leukoencephalopathy and demyelinating polyneuropathy.",0
Case,1
"The patient was a 26-year-old male who complained of gait disturbance that deteriorated over that started when he was 15 years old. He had no family history of neurological diseases. His past medical history included recurrent bowel obstruction without any mechanical causes. His height was 171 cm, and his body weight was 46 kg. The patient exhibited a lower intelligence level (full IQ = 65). His cranial nerves showed bilateral ptosis, he had mild saccadic eye movement, and his speech was slurred. His muscle strength was slightly weak in the neck and all four limbs. Pinprick, position sense, and vibration sensation were",1

He displayed areflexia in the lower limbs, and no pathological reflexes or pyramidal tract signs. Muscle tonus was hypotonic. Pes cavus was seen, although no spinal deformities and no skin lesions were observed. The finger-nose-finger test demonstrated dysmetria and decomposition. The Romberg test was positive.",1
"Routine blood tests did not reveal any abnormalities including blood cell count, serum protein, renal or liver function, coagulopathy. In addition, tests for anti-SS-A/SS-B, and anti-ganglioside antibodies were negative. A cerebrospinal fluid study showed elevated protein (204 mg/dl) and no pleocytosis. Lactate and pyruvic acid were increased in the cerebrospinal fluid, although levels of these were normal in the serum.",1
Brain MRI revealed diffuse leukoencephalopathy (Fig. 1A) and cerebellar atrophy. Nerve conduction studies showed reduced conduction velocities and markedly prolonged distal motor latencies with a decreased amplitude of compound muscle action potentials in the bilateral tibial nerves. The F wave minimum latency of these nerves was prolonged (Table 1). Temporal dispersion was detected in the bilateral tibial nerves (Fig. 1B). Sural nerves were not evoked bilaterally. The electrophysiological diagnosis was demyelinating sensorimotor polyneuropathy.,1
"Because needle electromyography revealed early recruitment with short duration and low amplitude in paraspinal muscles, we next performed a muscle biopsy from his biceps brachii. Pathological findings following modified Gomori trichrome staining showed scattered, ragged-red fibers (Fig. 1C).",1
"Based on the above findings, we diagnosed the patient with mitochondrial disease with demyelinating sensorimotor polyneuropathy and gastrointestinal manifestations. TP activity was within the reference range. Long-range PCR and Southern hybridization revealed multiple deletions in the patient’s mtDNA, and POLG sequencing analysis with the patient and his parents showed compound heterozygous mutations in POLG1: c.895A > C and c.3626_3629dupGATA (Supplementary Figure).

"Sudden neurological deterioration due to repeated intratumoral hemorrhage in a patient with a vestibular schwannoma Mostafa Fatehi Hassanabad ⇑, Ryojo Akagami Division of Neurosurgery, Vancouver General Hospital, 899, 12th Avenue West, Vancouver V5Z1M9, Canada a r t i c l e i n f o Article history: Received 5 August 2018 Accepted 6 October 2018 a b s t r a c t",0
Vestibular schwannomas (VS) are the most common tumors involving the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) and the internal auditory canal (IAC). These tumors are usually slow-growing and commonly present with cranial nerve dysfunction such as hearing loss. Repeated intratumoral hemorrhage (ITH) is extremely rare with only four cases previously reported.,0
"We report the case of a 30 year old female with a right sided CP angle tumor who presented with vertigo and ataxia due to ITH. Her symptoms initially improved; however, three weeks later, she had acute onset of facial palsy and imaging confirmed rebleeding. Surgical pathology reported typical features of schwannoma.",0
A literature review performed using the PubMed and EMBASE databases yielded four previous reports. A summary of these cases is presented and the features of ITH are discussed. Patients affected by repeated ITH present with sudden headache and ataxia. Rapid worsening of cranial nerve dysfunction such as hearing loss or facial nerve palsy is suggestive of ITH. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 1. Case presentation,0
"A 30 year old female with a prior history of Hodgkin’s lymphoma and gradual hearing loss was found to have a right CP angle mass in June 2016. An MRI in June 2016 further characterised the lesion and showed no significant change in size (Fig. 1). After consultation with a neurosurgeon, the patient elected to undergo watchful surveillance. In the ensuing months, the patient developed further hearing loss and hemifacial numbness (CN V2 and V3 distribution); however, follow-up MR imaging in January and June 2017 remained largely stable in size (Fig. 2).",0

However, the day before her scheduled procedure, the patient developed sudden headache and noticed rapidly progressive right facial nerve palsy. Urgent imaging confirmed repeat intratumoral hemorrhage (Fig. 4). The patient had intact level of consciousness throughout and her lower cranial nerves were not affected.",0
"Preoperatively, the patient had right-sided, House-Brackmann (HB) grade IV, facial nerve weakness, no hearing on the right and decreased sensation in the right CN V2 and V3 distribution. Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring was performed with CN V, CNVII and CN X nerve EMG monitoring. Bilateral brainstem auditory-evoked responses (BAERs) and CNVII motor evoked potentials (MEP) were also monitored. Good subtotal (>85%) resection of the tumor was achieved and a rind of tumor",0
