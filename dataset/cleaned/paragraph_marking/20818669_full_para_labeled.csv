"Movement Disorders Vol. 25, No. 14, 2010, pp. 2461–2477 © 2010 Movement Disorder Society Letters to the Editor Related to New Topics Retina Thickness in Parkinson’s Disease and Essential Tremor Visual symptoms, particularly impaired foveal vision, are common among the nonmotor phenomena in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Experimental evidence from humans and monkeys shows that there are dopaminergic cells in the retina, including the amacrine subtype A18 with D1 and D2 receptors, and interplexiform cells.",0
"Postmortem studies have shown that PD eyes have lower dopamine content,1 compared with healthy controls. Likewise, a loss in the sensitivity to contrast and color vision, altered visual evoked potential, and electroretinographic measurements have been observed, indicating foveal retinal ganglion cells damage in PD.2",0
"Quantitative morphology of gross retinal histology in humans can be measured in vivo using time domain Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). In PD a thinning of the peripapillary retinal nerve ﬁber layer, which represents axons of the ganglion cells, and macula have been shown, supporting the hypothesis that dopaminergic deﬁcit in the retina can cause structural changes.2–5 However, the usefulness of measuring foveal thickness by OCT as a diagnostic tool to differentiate PD from other tremor disease, such as essential tremor (ET) remains unknown. Therefore, the main purpose of this pilot study was to measure foveal thickness in patients with PD, and to compare it against a normal population and patients with ET.",0
"We designed a cross-sectional pilot study that included a consecutive sample of outpatients diagnosed with idiopathic PD in accordance with the UK Parkinson’s Disease Society brain bank, and ET based on clinical criteria. Patients with any coexisting ocular disease were excluded. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the General Yagu¨e Hospital, Burgos (Spain), and all patients signed the informed consent before being enrolled. Control subjects were matched for age (6 5 years) and gender to PD patients. Demographic and PD/ET laterality data were collected. OCT was acquired through a dilated pupil by an experienced operator using the OCT3 (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, Calif), with axial resolution of < 10 lm. The macular thickness map analysis and the center foveal thickness was automatically determined by the OCT3 software.6 Images were considered to be of good quality if the signal-to-noise ratio was greater than 30dB or had more than 95% sweeps accepted.",0
"Data analysis was performed from an exploratory point of view using the statistical package SPSS program (SPSS 17; SPSS, Chicago). Only descriptive analysis was used, owing to the small sample size. Data were summarized as mean 6 Potential conﬂict of interest: Nothing to report. Published online 28 July 2010 in Wiley Online Library (wileyonlinelibrary.com). DOI: 10.1002/mds.23215 standard deviation, and median (range). To maintain independence of all observations, right eye [RE] versus left eye [LE] were analyzed for each patient.",0
"Fifty-two eyes from 9 patients with PD (5 men and 4 women) with a mean age of 64.1 + 12 years and disease duration of 8.4 6 1.9 years, 8 patients with ET (4 men and 4 women) with a mean age of 67.8 6 4.8 years and disease duration of 23.7 6 18.3 years, and 9 controls were included. The mean foveal thickness was thinner in the PD group compared with the ET group and controls (Table 1). For the PD and ET groups, the mean foveal thickness was also thinner in the contra lateral eye of the most affected side (Table 1).",0
"In this pilot study, based on the OCT imaging, the fovea was thinner in the PD group compared with the ET group and controls. Interestingly, whereas interocular macular symmetry has been found in the normal population,7 we found that the foveal thickness was asymmetric and thinner in the eye contralateral to the side more affected by tremor and parkinsonism in the ET and PD groups, respectively. Hajee et al, also found the correlation between thinning in the left and the right eye of the same was not perfect.7 Hence, this interocular foveal asymmetry should be considered in interpretation. Except that for ET, although mild tremor asymmetry has been documented as a fundamental characteristic of ET, there is no published information regarding foveal thickness in patients with ET. The similar asymmetry ﬁnding in ET is difﬁcult to understand, and we cannot obviously explain it based on our preliminary data. However, abnormal OCT measures have also been found in other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and spinocerebellar ataxias, most likely related to the loss of retinal ganglion cells and axons.8 Therefore, further studies are required to establish whether OCT measures contribute for a sensitive and speciﬁc diagnosis of PD and to differentiate it from other conditions. We recognize our results cannot be compared with prior OCT reports in PD because of the different imaging map protocol and equipment. We are also aware that because of the small sample size used, these results need to be repeated in larger cohorts to ensure reproducibility.",0
"With regards to technical feasibility, the OCT compared with other expensive ones, such as the single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies using 123I-FP-CIT (DAT scan), is widely available, fast, as it only takes a few minutes to perform, and relatively inexpensive. Based on our preliminary data, and in accordance with other authors,2–5 we believe that foveal thickness measured by the OCT could be a promising, feasible biomarker of PD, by quantifying the morphological changes of retinal dopaminergic neurons.",0

"A large proportion of patients suffering from Parkinson’s disease presents with urinary dysfunction described as urgency, increased frequency or incontinence as predominant symptoms2,3 and also STN-DBS has proven to improve urinary function.4 Data from experimental urodynamic measures in men and animal models have demonstrated a signiﬁcant inﬂuence of STN-DBS on urinary bladder function.5,6 In these studies, the main effect of STN-DBS appeared to be a normalization of urodynamic parameters but there is no data reported about kidney function in these patients.7 Despite its clinical efﬁcacy, the manifold physiological consequences of STN-DBS are to date poorly understood.",0

"STN-DBS has been shown to ameliorate bladder dysfunction (increases bladder capacity) in patients with Parkinson’s disease, by modulation of sensory processing.9 It appears to be a normalization of urodynamic parameters, but there is no data reported about kidney function in these patients.",0
"In our patients kidney function was altered immediately after surgery. A decline in ﬁltration function developed after STN-DBS and some patients without preoperative RI developed acute RI postoperatively. In these patients no urinary retention occurred, urinary volume was similar before and after surgery. No preoperative hemodynamic complications, as dehydration occurred; like other series, neurostimulator implantation anesthetic technique is not associated with major hemodynamic adverse effects.10",0
"A recent study of experimentally induced ARF showed that there is a close interaction between the kidney and the central nervous system.11 Sympathetic inﬂuence in kidney functions is under control of brainstem biogenic amine cell groups and hypothalamic nuclei.12,13 It cannot be excluded that there may be regional effects of DBS-STN on hypothalamic centers, depending on the exact location of the contacts in the STN area.",0
"Effect of DBS-STN in hypothalamic centers remains a valid hypothesis which could explain an altered kidney function immediately after surgery, but further investigations are required to explore this possible mechanism. With these preliminary results the authors suggest that it is necessary to evaluate CC before and after surgery for early orientation of patients with RI.

We have found one report of chorea associated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors.5 However, the patient also improved despite recommencement and maintenance of her monoamine oxidase inhibitor. An adverse reaction to this medication, such as serotonin syndrome, is therefore also unlikely.

"Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is one of the earliest nonmotor symptoms of Idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD).1 Hyposmia in PD is generally bilateral and remains unaffected by parkinsonian medication.1 Despite of its high occurrence, little is really known about the mechanisms of olfactory loss.2 Most hypotheses raised to explain this phenomenon involve neurodegenerative processes of olfactory structures.3 The authors report a case and the ﬂuorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET ﬁndings of a patient who underwent bilateral deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) and subsequently developed a great improvement in motor symptoms paralleled by an impressive recovery of olfaction after surgery.",0
"A 51-year-old man with advanced PD, severe motor ﬂuctuations, and incapacitating levodopa-induced dyskinesias underwent bilateral STN-DBS. He presented early onset of PD symptoms (35 years-old). Eight years ago, he started complaining of severe loss of olfaction discrimination (he seldom perceived very intense and unpleasant fragrances) and loss of libido. His motor scores on the UPDRS part III in ON medication were 35 and 74 in OFF medication condition. Chronic monopolar stimulation was applied on the contacts corresponding to the STN (two distal contacts on each side as the cathodes—1.7 V (right), 2.0 V (left), pulse width 210 ls, and frequency of 130 Hz). At ﬁve months on postoperative follow-up, the patient had experienced improvement in the UPDRS part III score (16 ONmed/ONstim vs. 39 OFFmed/ONstim). During a routine visit, the patient spontaneously reported marked improvement in his olfactory function. Olfaction was assessed using the brief smell identiﬁcation test (12-items, B-SIT).4 He recognized the odor of eight of twelve substances, score considered normal olfaction for someone his age, according to the Doty’s values.1",0

"tion to one of the substances (B-SIT). The second PET study was performed under the same conditions, but the stimulator had been turned off for seven days. At this time, the patient experienced return of hyposmia, as he observed and reported spontaneously. The OD at this point corresponded to the identiﬁcation of 2/12 fragrances in B-SIT. The results of PET images revealed signiﬁcant metabolic activation of thalamus, striatum, nucleus accumbens, and amygdaloid complex bilaterally as well as the left gyrus rectus. The tissue around the electrode also revealed metabolic activation, from deep STN extending to ventral thalamus (Fig. 1).",0
"Previous reports have stated that odor discrimination improves after STN-DBS in PD patients, while olfactory detection threshold does not. These results suggest that STNDBS might modulate cognitive processing of olfactory information.5 The return to hyposmia after the stimulation was turned off, favors the hypothesis that functional changes in striatum-thalamus-cortical networks, rather than irreversible degeneration of olfactory structures only, are responsible for OD observed in PD patients. The progressive neuronal loss throughout the brain generates dysfunction in the chronometry of circuits of the basal ganglia affecting different systems interpreted clinically as various symptoms of PD. Once the hyper activation of STN is reversed by the onset of local electrical stimulation, its inﬂuence spreads out to other neural circuits correcting dysfunctions of modulatory neurotransmitters, which in turn is related to the temporary improvement of motor and nonmotor symptoms. Although data in previous studies6 suggest that the motor effect obtained by dopaminergic medication and by STN stimulation shares the same activated brain areas, this is not likely to happen with olfactory function because dopaminergic reposition has no effect on hyposmia.1",0
"In line with previous reports, PET signs of motor improvement, attenuation of the Parkinson disease related pattern (PDRP)6 was expressed, except for a residual hypermetabolism in left striatum observed in the present study. Although a remarkable motor improvement was observed in this patient, the expected abolition of PDRP was not fully",0
"expressed. This apparent inconsistency may be related to individual variability in a single subject analysis or it may suggest the participation of left striatum in the olfactory information-processing network in this patient. Also, a substantial increase in metabolism in the vicinity of the subthalamic target site extending rostrally into the ventral thalamus was observed. Since the FDG hypermetabolism was highly coincident with the location of electrodes, this component is probably related to the direct effects of electrical stimulation of STN, inhibiting depolarization on the cell membrane.6 The electrode trajectory performed in this patient includes the motor anterior ventralis oralis nucleus of thalamus/posterior ventralis oralis nucleus of thalamus (VoA/VoP), as observed in the postoperative MRI, the upper contact is located within the ventral portion of thalamus. Besides the activation of amygdaloid complex, hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, thalamus, midbrain, and cerebellum related to olfactory stimulation in PD patients, as shown by Westermann et al.,7 also observed in this case, there was additional activation of bilateral nucleus accumbens and left gyrus rectus. Although further studies are required for more robust conclusions, the present ﬁndings suggest that the activated areas may mediate the odor discrimination improvement after bilateral STN-DBS. The stimulation of thalamic region in this case might also have activated thalamic nuclei related to olfactory function [e.g., nucleus parataenialis of thalamus (Pt)]. The connections of the Pt nucleus arise from the secondary olfactory centers through stria medullaris of thalamus.8 The activation of this nucleus could inﬂuence the olfactory circuitry at distant sites once reports of olfactory sensation were observed by direct electrical stimulation of this region.9",0
"These preliminary observations suggest that OD in PD may rather be a circuitry dysfunction and not only a neurodegenerative process in olfactory structures; a dysfunction of cognitive processing involved in odor discrimination might explain this phenomenon. There are multiple levels of integration of olfactory information and the STN-DBS seems to inﬂuence the circuit involving the primary olfactory areas, limbic areas as the ventral striatum and basal frontal cortex.

Familial Nonkinesigenic Paroxysmal Dyskinesia and Intracranial Calciﬁcations: A New Syndrome?,0
"Paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD) refers to a clinical syndrome characterized by attacks of involuntary movements, including dystonia, chorea, athetosis, or ballism, occurring at rest.1,2 PNKD is associated to a wide range of aetiologies, for example, autoimmune, vascular, traumatic, infective, and endocrine disorders.1 However, most cases of PNKD are idiopathic and neuroimaging is usually unremarkable.1,2 We report a PNKD family whose computed tomography (CT) scan revealed intracranial calciﬁcations.",0
"This four-generation family includes 5 (one deceased) patients (Table 1; Fig. 1). The proband (individual IV:2) is 7year-old girl who experienced at age of 9 months a ﬁrst attack of dystonic posture of the head with concomitant ballistic and choreic movements of upper and lower extremities. This event lasted 30 minutes, without alteration of consciousness, and was followed by prompt recovery. One month later, the girl experienced a similar episode precipitated by fever and resolving spontaneously. Neurological examination between attacks was normal. Laboratory investigations (serum and urine copper, calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, ceruloplasmin, ferritin, transferrin, serum iron, thyroid, parathyroid, and adrenocorticotropic hormones, anti-transglutaminase antibodies, serum lipoproteins and lipid proﬁle, lactate, pyruvate, amino acids, and urine organic acids) were normal.

Individual I:1 who experienced a single attack at age 75 years related to febrile illness, was considered as probably affected, considering the transitory nature of his manifestation and the fact that fever was a precipitating factor also in other affected members, as reported in PNKD.6 The course of the disease was relatively benign and affected individuals achieved spontaneous remission or continued to have about yearly episodes without treatment.

"Indeed, the most distinctive feature in our family was the ﬁnding of symmetrical intracranial calciﬁcations, primarily affecting the basal ganglia, which has been previously reported in few isolated cases.8–11 Hereditary brain calcinosis may be found in several different conditions,12 for example, disorders of parathyroid hormone or calcium regulation, mitochondrial diseases, and defects of organic or amino acid metabolism. However, all these aetiologies were ruled out in our family. Linkage to 14q, described in families with Fahr disease and neurological symptoms,5 was excluded, conﬁrming that this condition is genetically heterogeneous.13,14 Moreover, the pathogenetic role of calciﬁcations remains unclear as the youngest patient showed unremarkable neuroimaging despite full phenotypical presentation. Identiﬁcation of further families could shed light on the pathogenesis of PNKD.",0

"The index patient (Patient 1) underwent uncomplicated surgery of a right-sided carpal tunnel syndrome at 32 years of age. Two weeks later, she developed complex regional pain syndrome of the operated limb with severe pain and allodynia. Another two weeks later, dystonic posturing of the right hand with rapid jerky wrist and ﬁnger movements manifested. These jerks consisted of a complex mixture of phasic dystonic wrist ﬂexions and small amplitude ﬁnger movements (polymini-myoclonus). In addition, continuous jerky movements of her feet at rest were observed (Supporting Information Video, Segment 1), which were presumably preexisting but unrecognized by the patient herself. These movements were unpatterned and similar to limb movements seen in patients with benign hereditary chorea.1,4 EEG and SEP recordings showed no cortical correlates of the limb jerks but temporo-parietal focal slowing and intermittent temporal sharp-slow waves. As the forceful wrist and ﬁnger movements triggered pain attacks, injections to wrist and ﬁnger extensors and ﬂexors were given with a total dose of 800 U botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNTA); (Dysport, Ipsen Pharma).",1
"Injections dramatically reduced movement-induced pain attacks and were repeated every 3-month since then (Supporting Information Video, Segment 2). Severe depression with recurrent anxiety attacks necessitated admission to the local psychiatric hospital. Secondary generalized seizures and premature amenorrhoea started at the age of 33 years. Comprehensive neuropsychological testing revealed below-average cognitive capacities. At the age of 35 years, she started to develop sensory neuropathy, mild external ophthalmoplegia, and subtle gait ataxia, yet without leading to incapacitations in daily life (Supporting Information Video, Segment 3) (for MRI images, see Fig. 1).",0
"Patient 2, the index patient’s sister, manifested with slowly progressive cognitive deﬁcits during primary school, leading to severe cognitive deﬁcits at the age of 40. At age 13 years, epileptic seizures, recurrent headaches, and mild personality changes started. The movement disorder was similar to her sister’s: action-triggered myoclonus started at the left arm at age 14 years and generalized afterwards, whereas dystonic ulnar deviation of the right hand with ﬂexion of the ﬁngers III–V was ﬁrst noticed at age 20 years. Since then, she also developed progressive cerebellar ataxia and became wheel-chair bound at the age of 31. At the last examination (age 40 years) incomplete chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO); (Supporting Information Video, Segment 5) and severe axonal sensorimotor neuropathy were detected.

"Our ﬁndings demonstrate that POLG mutations should be considered in the workup of progressive complex hyperkinetic movement disorders. As of yet, hyperkinetic movements like myoclonus and chorea have been mentioned in POLG patients mainly as part of a plethora of POLG-associated symptoms.2,3 As shown in Patient 1, complex hyperkinetic movements presenting with myoclonus, dystonia, and possibly also choreic elements may be the only feature seen for several years. This ﬁnding moreover demonstrates that not only apraxia of eye lid opening7 and dystonic toe curling,8 but also upper limb dystonia is part of the spectrum of POLG-associated dystonia.",1
"Interestingly, the disease course in Patient 1 shows that cerebellar ataxia, sensory neuropathy, and/or PEO are not necessarily presenting or early features of autosomal-recessive-POLG (AR-POLG) mutations. A family history with consanguineous marriage and/or recessive inheritance (like in our pedigree) or POLG-characteristic features in the disease course (like in Patient 1) may support the decision for POLG sequencing in undiagnosed patients with hyperkinetic movement disorders. Legends to the Video Patient 1",0
"Segment 1. At the age of 33 years, Patient 1 showed dystonia of both arms, with predominant dystonic ulnar deviation of the right upper limb with jerky wrist and ﬁnger movements, which had started four weeks after carpal tunnel surgery induced CRPS. Distal ﬁnger movements have smaller amplitudes characteristic of polymini-myoclonus. Also her feet show unpatterend jerky movements, which may be classiﬁed as myoclonus but are also similar to limb movements in benign hereditary chorea.1,4",1
"Segment 2. Botulinum toxin treatment of extensor and ﬂexor muscles of the right forearm markedly reduced hyperkinetic movements. The main therapeutic goal remained pain reduction. Apart from the botulinum toxin effect, also intermittent mirror movements can be observed in this segment. Segment 3. At the age of 35 years, external ophthalmoplegia, slowing of voluntary saccades and gait ataxia started. Also, a reduced arm swing on the right side was ﬁrst noticed. Patient 2",0
"Segment 4. At the age of 40 years, Patient 2 displayed dystonic ulnar deviation of the left upper limb with distal predominance. She showed intermittent facial and jaw opening dystonia. At rest, she had marked postural instability caused by trunk ataxia, which is aggravated by motor actions like e.g. lifting the upper limbs. Segment 5. In Patient 2 severe dysarthria, incomplete horizontal and vertical external ophthalmoplegia and ataxia were observed as clinical features of MIRAS. Patient 2 was only able to stand assisted for a few seconds.",1
