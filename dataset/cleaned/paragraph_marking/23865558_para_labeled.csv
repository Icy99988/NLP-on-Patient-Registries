"Novel polymerase gamma (POLG1) gene mutation in the linker domain associated with parkinsonism Rachel Dolhun, Erin M Presant and Peter Hedera* Background",1
"Mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (POLG1) is a nuclear-encoded protein critical for the synthesis, replication and repair of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Abnormal function of this sole mtDNA polymerase leads to defective oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production. Impaired integrity of mtDNA with its depletion or deletion causes a broad spectrum of both non-neurological and neurological phenotypes [1]. Greater than one hundred pathogenic mutations in this enzyme have been found since it was first described [2]. These include, but are not limited to parkinsonism, chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO), cerebellar ataxia, sensory polyneuropathy, Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome, which is characterized by progressive encephalopathy with seizures and hepatic failure, isolated myoclonic epilepsy or non-syndromic liver failure. [2-6] This wide variety of distinct and seemingly unrelated clinical problems with both autosomal dominant (AD) or recessive (AR)",0
"* Correspondence: peter.hedera@vanderbilt.edu Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University, 465 21st Avenue South, 6140 MRB III, Nashville, TN, USA inheritance presents a significant challenge to clinicians and a high degree of clinical suspicion is typically crucial for the recognition of the underlying genetic mechanism. Here we report a novel mutation in POLG1 located in the linker domain of this gene in a patient with parkinsonism and CPEO. Case presentation",0
"Presented patient is a 79-year old Caucasian who developed first neurologic problems in his thirties with bilateral ptosis and double vision. The ophthalmologic examination showed a progressive ophthalmoplegia and he required several corrective eyelid surgeries to mitigate his ptosis. Shortly thereafter, he developed a shuffling gait and overall slowness of movements. He experienced a gradual progression of his rigidity, bradykinesia without any significant asymmetry, hypophonia and within 10–15 years he also developed camptocormia with subsequent postural instability (Additional file 1).",1
"Parkinsonism was partially responsive to dopaminergic replacement with carbidopa/levodopa with the highest used dose of 1250 mg per day. Later, amantadine at the dose of 300 mg/day was added for his gait difficulties © 2013 Dolhun et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

"with reported improvement. Both medications were later reduced because of hallucinations. Dementia, treated with memantine and donepezil, was diagnosed at the age of 75 years. Family history was positive for external ophthalmoplegia and Parkinson’s disease diagnosed in his father and brother. We could not personally examine his brother but available history indicated that he was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease and reported a good response to 600 mg of levodopa per day.",1
We performed muscle biopsy because of suspicion for a mitochondrial disorder at the age of 70 years. Muscle biopsy obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle revealed nonspecific changes with some irregularities of cytochrome c-oxidase staining but ragged red fibers were not seen. These changes alone were not sufficient for the definite diagnosis of a mitochondrial myopathy. Repeat biopsy was considered with sampling of additional muscles but the patient declined. Brain MRI showed only mild scattered white matter abnormalities.,1
Sequencing of the POLG1 gene was done by Sanger sequencing. DNA extraction from blood was carried out using standard procedures. All exons of the POLG1 gene were amplified by PCR reaction with previously published intron-based primers [7]. Bidirectional Sanger sequencing was performed for each amplicon and detected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were compared with available public domain databases. We identified a novel heterozygous p.K512M mutation (c.1535A>T) (Figure 1). In silico analysis of this single nucleotide polymorphism,1
"using PolyPhen-2 software (http://genetics.bwh.harvard. edu/pph2) predicted that this change is possibly damaging with a score of 0.906 (sensitivity 0.82 and specificity 0.94). This is a highly conserved position in the linker region of the POLG1 protein (Figure 2) and sequencing of 100 normal, ethnically matched control individuals did not identify this sequence changes, further supporting its role as a disease-causing mutation.",0
"Mutations in the adenosine nucleotide translocator 1 (ANT1) and twinkle (C10ORF2) genes have also been associated with CPEO and additional neurologic problems, including parkinsonism [8,9]. We also sequenced all coding exons of these genes using the same approach as for POLG1 analysis but no putative mutations were identified. Conclusions",0
