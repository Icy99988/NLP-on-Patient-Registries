"Background Mitochondrial disorders are clinically heterogeneous diseases associated with impaired oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activity. POLG, which encodes the DNA polymerase-γ (Polγ) catalytic subunit, is the most commonly mutated nuclear gene associated with mitochondrial disorders.",0
"Methods We carried out whole-exome sequencing (WES) to identify the gene associated with progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO). We then performed histopathological analyses, assessed mitochondrial biology, and executed functional studies to evaluate the potential pathogenicity of the identified genetic mutations.",0
"Results Novel biallelic POLG mutations, including a large deletion mutation (exons 7–21) and a missense variant c.1796C>T (p.Thr599Ile) were detected in the proband. Histopathological analysis of a biopsied muscle sample from this patient revealed the presence of approximately 20% COX-negative fibers. Bioinformatics analyses confirmed that the detected mutations were pathogenic. Furthermore, levels of mitochondrial complex I, II, and IV subunit protein expressions were found to be decreased in the proband, and marked impairment of mitochondrial respiration was evident in cells harboring these mutations.",1
Conclusion This study expands the spectrum of known POLG variants associated with PEO and advances current understanding regarding the structural and functional impacts of these mutations.

"(OXPHOS) defects [1, 2]. These disorders can originate from mutated nuclear DNA (nDNA) or in maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) [2, 3]. Over 1100 nDNA-encoded proteins are found in mitochondria, including OXPHOS subunits, assembly factors, and proteins related to other essential mitochondrial functions [4].",0
"mtDNA polymerase γ (Polγ) is a key regulator of mtDNA replication and homeostasis [5–7]. Human Polγ is a heterotrimeric protein complex containing the catalytic 140kDa POLG subunit encoded by POLG (MIM 174763) on chromosome 15q25 and the 55-kDa accessory subunit POLG2 encoded by POLG2 (MIN 604983) on chromosome 17q24.1[7]. POLG possesses both 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity and 5′ → 3′ polymerization activity. POLG genetic variants affect mtDNA stability and nucleotide metabolism, resulting in mtDNA defects including deletions, depletions, base-pair substitutions, and rearrangements, which can in turn give rise to mitochondrial diseases [5, 8, 9].",0
POLG is the nuclear gene that is most often mutated in the context of mitochondrial disorders. Van Goethem et al. first,0
"reported a POLG variant in a Belgian patient with progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) in 2001 [10]. Since then, POLG has been the focus of intensive research. To date, there are approximately 300 related POLG variants have been documented (http://tools.niehs.nih. gov/polg/), the majority of which are point mutations, whereas POLG deletion mutations are extremely rare and have been identified only sporadically. POLG variant-related disorders are associated with a heterogeneous array of pathogenic mechanisms, clinical presentations, and outcomes. Neurological disorders may include devastating infantile disorders such as AlpersHuttenlocher syndrome (AHS), mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndrome (MIRAS), myocerebrohepatopathy spectrum (MCHS), juvenile and adult-onset myoclonic epilepsy, ataxia neuropathy spectrum (ANS), sensory ataxia neuropathy dysarthria and ophthalmoplegia (SANDO), and mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy (MNGIE). Such variants can also cause late-onset disorders including myopathies such as PEO and certain movement disorder syndromes [5, 11–15].",0
"PEO, which is the most prevalent form of mitochondrial myopathy, usually presents with progressive bilateral ptosis, diffuse symmetric ocular motility reductions, and exercise intolerance [16, 17]. Approximately half of all PEO cases originate from nDNA mutations in genes like POLG, POLG2, SLC25A4, C10orf2, TWINKLE, PEO1, RRM2B, TK2, or OPA1 [16, 18–21]. The most prevalent POLG pathogenic variants include c.1399G>A (p.A467T) and c.2344G>C (p.W748S), which are closely related to autosomal-dominant (AD) and/or autosomal-recessive(AR) PEO [8, 22–24].",0
"In our study, we report the case of a 33-year-old male with PEO harboring novel biallelic mutations in the POLG gene, including a large deletion mutation (exons 7–21) and a missense variant c.1796C>T (p.Thr599Ile). We confirmed the pathogenicity of these mutations based on a combination of clinical, genetical, and biochemical investigations. Materials and methods Subject",1
"This 33-year-old male was the only child born to a nonconsanguineous healthy couple. The patient first presented with strabismus and ptosis 9 months ago, accompanied by the gradual development of ophthalmoplegia. Aside from these ocular complaints, he did not report any other clinically relevant symptoms. The patient had no family history of known mitochondrial disease. A neurologic examination revealed bilateral ptosis, left exotropia (20 prism diopters), and ophthalmoparesis associated with mildly restricted eye movement. Reflexes, strength, and sensation examinations were all normal for this patient. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),",1
"electromyography (EMG), blood testing, and electroencephalography (EEG) findings were all normal. Informed consent for diagnosis and research studies was received from the patient. The study protocol was agreed upon the ethics committee of Qilu Hospital. Genomic analysis",0
"After informed consent was provided, total genomic DNA was isolated from the peripheral blood and/or biopsied skeletal muscle samples from the proband and his parents using a DNA Isolation Kit (Blood DNA Kit V2, CW2553). Purification was then performed with Agencourt AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter), and targeted DNA samples were sequenced via whole-exome sequencing (WES) according to standard Illumina protocols using a Novaseq 6000 platform. The Burrows-Wheeler Alignment (BWA) Tool was used to align paired-end 200-bp reads to the human reference genome (hg19). Data were then collected and subjected to bioinformatics analyses, and candidate variants were analyzed based upon American College Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines. Traditional Sanger sequencing was employed for the confirmation of the identified variants and to test the carrier status of clinically unaffected family members.",0
mtDNA deletion analysis DNA was obtained from muscle biopsies and peripheral blood samples from the proband according to standard protocols. The entire mitochondrial genome was screened via wholeexome sequencing (WES) and long-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Identification of pathogenic POLG variants,0
"The pathogenicity of novel missense variants was assessed based on the following criteria: (1) the variants exhibited full disease phenotype co-segregation; (2) the involved amino acid residue was conserved; (3) the mutation was predicted to be associated with functional consequences according to analyses conducted using SIFT (http://www.sift.jcvi.org/), MutationTaster (http://www.mutationtaster.org), and PolyPhen (http://www.genetics. bwh.harvard.edu/pph/); (4) the affected amino acid was located in important functional domains; (5) a distinct disease-causing variant was known to exist at the same position; and (6) the variant was absent in 100 normal controls.",0
"Crystal structure determination The structural impact of POLG variants was visualized and analyzed using the holoenzyme coordinate sets (pdb code: 5c53) and PyMOL (v2.0.6). A point variant model was produced using UCSF chimera. A large deletion predictive model was generated using the I-Tasser, Phyre2, and SWISSMODEL programs [25–27]. Histopathological examination",0
"A left biceps brachii biopsy sample was taken from the proband, with serial 10-μm-thick cryosections being stained based on conventional histological protocols [28]. Staining approaches used were as follows: hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, NADH-tetrazolium reductase staining, cytochrome c oxidase (COX) staining, modified Gomori trichrome (MGT) staining, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) staining, and SDH-COX double staining following incubation at a pH of 4.3 and 10.4. Cell culture and cell line generation",0
"Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) was used to immortalize lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) based upon a published protocol [29]. This approach was used to prepare cell lines from both the patient and ageand sex-matched healthy volunteers. All LCLs were grown using RPMI-1640 (Macgene), containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco) and 0.11 mg/mL pyruvate (Macgene). Western blotting",0
"Individual of 15–20 μg of protein samples retrieved from lysed muscle homogenates and LCLs were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, USA), which were subsequently blocked for 1 h using a 5% non-fat milk solution, followed by overnight incubation at 4°C with a total OXPHOS human antibody cocktail (ab110411, Abcam), or with antibodies specific for ND4 (A9941, ABclonal), ND1 (ab181848, Abcam), ND5 (ab92624, Abcam), CYB (ab81215, Abcam), CO4 (4850s,",0
"CST), β-actin (ab8226, Abcam), or GAPDH (ab8245, Abcam). After that, secondary HRP-linked antibodies were used to detect primary antibodies (Beyotime A0216, A0208). An ECL system (Tanon 4600 SF) was then used to detect protein bands, with ImageJ being used for densitometric analyses. Oxygen consumption rate measurements",0
"Cellular oxygen consumption rate (OCR) values were calculated using a Seahorse XFe24 instrument (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Different respiratory chain inhibitors were introduced in sequence to analyze cellular respiration. LCLs were seeded at 3 × 105 cells/well on plates coated with a CellTak™ adhesive (Corning) for 30 min. Cells were spun at 200×g for 1 min and were then incubated with culture medium for 30 min. The XFe24 cartridge was placed in calibration solution at 37°C for 12 h. For more details regarding these assay protocols, see prior studies [30]. Mitochondrial stress test",0
"Culture medium was replaced with assay medium (Cat# 103334-100, Seahorse Biosciences). Cells were then exposed to the inhibitors listed below: oligomycin A (1 μM), carbonyl cyanide 4-trifluoromethoxy-phenylhydrazone (FCCP, 0.5 μM), rotenone (1 μM), and antimycin A (1 μM). Assay medium and inhibitors were adjusted to a pH of 7.4 prior to use.

"mM, and BSA 0.2% (w/v)) was added in its place, while pyruvate (10 mM), malate (5 mM), and FCCP (0.5 μM) were used as buffer substrates. Digitonin (25 μg/ml, Sigma) was used to permeabilize cells. The injections were composed of rotenone (2 μM), succinate (10 mM), antimycin A (5 μM), ascorbate (10 mM), and N, N,N′, N′-tetramethyl-pphenylenediamine (TMPD, 0.5 mM). All solutions and injections had a pH of 7.2. Statistical analysis",0
"The presented data are given as means ± standard deviations (SDs). Normally distributed data were analyzed via independent two-sample t-tests or one-way ANOVAs as appropriate using SPSS 22.0 (IBM, IL, USA). P < 0.05 was the significance threshold for this study. Results Recognizing novel pathogenic POLG mutations",0
"Using a WES approach, we identified two novel biallelic POLG mutations in the proband patient, including a large deletion mutation between exons 7 and 21 and a missense variant in exon 10 (c.1796C>T, p.Thr599Ile). To identify the breakpoints of the deleted allele, a PCR assay was then designed, and subsequent PCR product sequencing revealed a large 9223-bp deletion within POLG (chr15: 89,861,596-89,870,890).",1
"When this region was further analyzed via long-range PCR, the large intragenic deletion was confirmed de novo (Fig. 1D, E). The novel missense variant (c.1796C>T, p.T599I) was inherited from the proband’s",0

Genomic DNA sequencing revealed novel biallelic mutations in the POLG gene, including a missense variant (exon 10, c.1796C>T, p.Thr599Ile) inherited from the father, and a spontaneous large deletion mutation (E7–E21). Owing to the large deletion, the missense variant was homozygous in the proband. A multi-alignment analysis demonstrated that the affected amino acid residue was highly conserved among different species. The PolyPhen-2",0
"predictive tool designated this mutation as being “probably damaging.” Long-range PCR analysis of the POLG gene using primers located in introns 7 and 21. A full-length product (9553 bp) was detectable in the mother (I-1), the father (I-2), the patient (II-1), and a healthy control (C). However, a 260-bp deletion product was also detected in a heterozygous state in the patient (primers: forward 5′-gctaaggctgaagaaaataaatgtgt-3′ and reverse 5′-attttccaaatagaaaagcgtgagta-3′).

"father. There are no prior records of these two variants in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD, www. hgmd.cf.ac.uk/) or on PubMed. A multi-alignment analysis further demonstrated that this missense variant modulated highly conserved amino acids. The PolyPhen-2 and Mutation Taster prediction programs further indicated that the c.1796C>T variant was damaging, while SIFT predicted this variant to be tolerated (Fig. 1B, C). The effect of the detected mutations on POLG structure",0
"We assessed the impact of these biallelic mutations on the structure of Polγ. Interactive visualizations of this holoenzyme, which consists of the catalytic POLG subunit and the homodimeric POLG2 accessory subunit, were constructed using PyMOL. Predictive protein",0
"structural analyses of the large deletion in POLG were analyzed via three computational approaches. Despite the presence of the exonuclease domain in the mutant protein, the majority of the polymerase domain was removed by this deletion, and this mutation was predicted to be highly disruptive to the enzymatic functionality (Fig. 2A). Using the UCSF Chimera program, we next created a model of the T599I substitution. The hydrogen bond between threonine 599 and serine 593 was predicted to stabilize the linkage between the polymerase and spacer domain, as well as the binding of DNA to this enzyme. Relative to the wild-type enzyme, this mutant isoform exhibited significant structural changes. Based upon the structural position of T599 and its interactions with surrounding amino acids, we speculated that polymorphisms affecting residues 592, 593, 594, and 595 may also interfere with the structural stability of POLG (Fig. 2B).",0

"mtDNA deletion analysis Deep mitochondrial genome sequencing conducted by NGS and long-range PCR amplification revealed the presence of a substantial mtDNA deletion (positions 5836-13922) in muscle samples but not blood samples from this patient, suggesting that the presence of mtDNA deletion is more common in postmitotic tissues in this genetic context (Supplementary Fig. 1). Histopathological analysis",0
"Serial biceps brachii sections revealed pathological feature of typical mitochondrial disease. About 20% COX-negative fibers were observed upon MGT staining, with the majority being ragged red fibers (RRFs). SDH and S/C staining also revealed ragged blue fibers (RBFs) and blue-staining fibers, respectively, further supporting the diagnosis of mitochondrial disease (Fig. 3). Mitochondrial protein level reductions",1
"To assess whether the identified variants affected OXPHOS subunit expression, we examined the levels of mtDNAencoded respiratory complex subunits expression and the nDNA-encoded respiratory complex subunits expression in muscle tissues and LCLs via Western blot. GAPDH or βactin were used as endogenous controls for these Western blotting assays. The levels of CO1 and nDNA-encoded NDUFB8 were strongly suppressed in the muscle tissue sample from this patient, where the nDNA-encoded SDHB expression was slightly reduced (Fig. 4A). Nine",0

Respiration deficiencies in mutant LCLs",1
"In order to further investigate whether these identified variants modulated cellular bioenergetic activity, we next utilized a Seahorse XFe24 instrument to analyze control and mutant LCL respiratory functionality. Basal OCR in the resting state was reduced by 26.1% (P = 0.013) in mutant LCLs relative to control LCLs. We additionally employed electron transport chain (ETC) inhibitors or uncoupling agents to gauge the impact of the tested mutations on mitochondrial function in these cells. Relative to control cells, the ATP generation, proton leakage, maximum respiration, and spare capacity OCR values in mutant cells were lowered to 63.1% (P = 0.012), 72.3% (P = 0.203), 39.2% (P = 0.001), and 23.5% (P <",0
", respectively (Fig. 5A, B). To elucidate the sitespecific regulation of this variant on mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) activities, we examined complex I-, II-, and IVmediated respiration in permeabilized LCLs. We discovered that mutant LCLs displayed marked reductions in all complex I-, II-, and IV-mediated respiration, as opposed to control LCLs (61.9%, 44.9%, and 83.7%, respectively) (Fig. 5C, D). Discussion",0
"Herein, we described novel biallelic POLG mutations in a 33-year-old male with PEO, including a large deletion mutation (exons 7 – 21 ) and a missense variant c.1796C>T (p.Thr599Ile). Several lines of evidence suggested the pathogenicity of these novel biallelic mutations. First, this patient exhibited clinical symptoms and histological features consistent with adult-onset PEO. Second, these genetic defects co-segregated with the observed phenotype in the affected family. Third, large mtDNA deletions were identified in muscle samples from this patient. Fourth, these biallelic mutations resulted in reduced mitochondrial respiratory complex expression, with a particularly notable impact on the levels of complex I, II, and IV subunit expressions in the analyzed samples. Finally, LCLs carrying these variants exhibited marked mitochondrial dysfunction.",1
"POLG is the nuclear gene that is most often found to be mutated in the context of mitochondrial disease [31]. Missense variants, accounting for 90% of reported POLG variants, are the most common form of such mutations. Deletion variants, however, are extremely rare, and have been identified only sporadically to date [5, 32]. In 2011, Tang et al. first reported a heterozygous large intragenic deletion (exons 15–21) with a common p.Ala467Thr variant in the POLG gene in an",0

"CO4, SDHB, and NDUFB8). In total, 20 μg samples of protein from mutant and control LCLs were analyzed. β-Actin was used as a loading control. The average levels of mitochondrial protein levels in mutant LCLs were compared to those in the control group. Values are from three separate experiments",0
"Alpers syndrome patient [33]. In 2014, Rouzier et al. demonstrated the presence of a heterozygous large intragenic deletion mutation (intron 21–exon 22) and a p.Trp748Ser mutation in a child with refractory epilepsia partialis continua [34]. According to the ACMG guidelines for the classification of sequence variants, large deletions are deleterious and thus represent the best candidates for pathogenic variants [35]. The case reported in the present study was the third patient found to harbor large deletion mutation in the POLG gene to date.",0
"We assessed the pathogenicity of the novel p.T599I variant. First, this variant fully co-segregated with the observed disease phenotype. The affected amino acid residue was highly conserved across various species, and the PolyPhen and MutationTaster predictive tools designated this variant as being damaging. Second, the threonine at position 599 is a crucial residue important",0
"for binding to upstream DNA. Using the PyMOL software, we found that the mutation of Thr-599 to Ile-599 disrupts hydrogen bond formation between residues 599 and 593, leading to the instability of the original hydrogen bonding framework and interfering with normal conformational transmission. Third, the novel T599I missense variant affected a highly conserved residue in the spacer domain. The spacer domain influences the conformation of the wall of the DNA-binding domain and is located between the exonuclease and polymerase domains where it is connected by the thumb subdomains [36]. Using the PyMOL and UCSF chimera programs, we found that the T599I variant blocks the DNA-binding channel and results in decreased DNAbinding affinity.",0

"A467T mutation is detected in roughly 36% of all POLG disease alleles, and it prevents the interaction between the POLG and POLG2 subunits, adversely impacting DNA synthesis and Polγ activity [38]. The W748S variant is the second most commonly documented POLG mutation in the POLG mutation database, exhibiting low-affinity DNA-binding activity and processivity but normal POLG2 interactions [39]. The G848S mutation is the third-most frequently detected POLG mutation and causes severely reduced DNA polymerase activity [40].",0
"In conclusion, we described novel biallelic POLG mutations, including a large deletion (exons 7–21) mutation and a missense variant c.1796C>T (p.T599I), which were associated with a clinical presentation of PEO in a 33-year-old male. Biochemical investigations demonstrated that these variants severely impaired mitochondrial function, thereby leading to mitochondrial disease. Our study expands the spectrum of POLG variants known to cause PEO, offering valuable new insights into POLG variants with respect to both their structural and functional consequences.",1
