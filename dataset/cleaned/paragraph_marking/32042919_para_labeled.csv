"To determine the pathogenicity of a novel POLG mutation in a man with late-onset autosomal recessive progressive external ophthalmoplegia using clinical, molecular, and biochemical analyses. Methods A multipronged approach with detailed neurologic examinations, muscle biopsy analyses, molecular genetic studies, and in vitro biochemical characterization. Results",0
"The patient had slowly progressive bilateral ptosis and severely reduced horizontal and vertical gaze. Muscle biopsy showed slight variability in muscle ﬁber size, scattered ragged red ﬁbers, and partial cytochrome c oxidase deﬁciency. Biallelic mutations were identiﬁed in the POLG gene encoding the catalytic A subunit of POLγ. One allele carried a novel mutation in the exonuclease domain (c.590T>C; p.F197S), and the other had a previously characterized null mutation in the polymerase domain (c.2740A>C; p.T914P). Biochemical characterization revealed that the novel F197S mutant protein had reduced exonuclease and DNA polymerase activities and conﬁrmed that T914P was inactive. By deep sequencing of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) extracted from muscle, multiple large-scale rearrangements were mapped and quantiﬁed.",1
"Conclusions The patient’s phenotype was caused by biallelic POLG mutations, resulting in one inactive POLγA protein (T914P) and one with decreased polymerase and exonuclease activity (F197S). The reduction in polymerase activity explains the presence of multiple pathogenic large-scale deletions in the patient’s mtDNA.

"Cells contain thousands of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecules that are maintained by a dedicated mitochondrial replication machinery encoded by nuclear genes.1,2 mtDNA is replicated by POLγ, a trimeric protein comprising one POLγA catalytic subunit and a dimer of the processivity factor POLγB.1",0
"Mutations in POLγA are one of the most frequent causes of mitochondrial disease, which is characterized by insuﬃciency in oxidative phosphorylation. Pathogenic POLγA mutations are associated with the accumulation of secondary mtDNA mutations and/or progressive mtDNA depletion due to errors in DNA replication.3–6 A common clinical manifestation of POLγA-related diseases is progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), a disorder involving progressive weakening of the extraocular muscles that is frequently combined with symptoms from other parts of the neuromuscular and nervous system.",0
"Here, we report a patient with PEO carrying biallelic POLγA mutations. One allele carries the previously characterized T914P null mutation in the polymerase domain,7 and the other allele carries the F197S mutation in the 39-59 exonuclease domain, which is described here for the ﬁrst time. To gain a molecular understanding of the patient’s phenotype, we performed clinical and laboratory investigations and characterized the biochemical properties of the mutant proteins. Methods Case report",1
"The patient investigated is a man aged 69 years. His father had kidney failure of unknown reason, and his mother died at age 92 years. Neither of them had ptosis, hearing impairment, or muscle complaints. He has a healthy 68-year-old brother and 2 healthy sons aged 33 years and 37 years. The patient had normal motor milestones as a child, did his military service at age 20 years, and has always been physically active. He has no history of migraines, visual or hearing impairment, and cardiac or cognitive complaints or symptoms. At age 55 years, he noted slowly progressive bilateral ptosis and also a limitation in both horizontal and vertical gaze. Since age 65 years, he has complete horizontal ophthalmoplegia, no upward gaze whatsoever, but has limited downward gaze. He has been bilaterally operated for ptosis. A complete clinical neurologic examination was otherwise normal except a slight bilateral sensory-neuronal hearing impairment thought to be a cochlear aﬄiction due to his mitochondrial disorder. Cardiac examination, including ECG and 24-hour Holter ECG, was normal. Brain MRI showed slight atrophy of the mesencephalon, pedunculus cerebelli superior, and frontotemporal parts of the brain. Clinically, he has no cognitive impairment, although no formal",1
"cognitive investigation has been performed. Serum creatine kinase, troponin T, Nt-pro-BNP, creatinine, cystatin C, and thyroid function tests were normal as was CSF examination. Morphologic analysis Open skeletal muscle biopsy from the deltoid muscle was performed at age 66 years. Specimens were snap frozen for cryostat sectioning and histochemistry. Standard techniques were applied for enzyme histochemistry.8 Molecular genetic analysis",0
"Exome sequencing (ES) was performed on blood DNA using the SureSelectXT Human All Exon kit v6 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and sequenced on the HiSeq2500 platform (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA). The paired-end reads were aligned to the reference genome (hg19) using the CLC Biomedical Genomics workbench (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Data were analyzed with Ingenuity Variant Analysis (QIAGEN). Candidate genes associated with myopathy were analyzed for biologically relevant variants that were predicted to be damaging using SIFT algorithm and PolyPhen2 and were not common in the human population (minor allele frequency below 1%).",0
Analysis of mtDNA deletions using deep sequencing,0
"DNA was isolated from muscle biopsies from the patient and 2 age-matched control individuals using standard protocols. DNA was subjected to whole-genome sequencing using the TruSeq PCR free library preparation kit (Illumina), and the Illumina HiSeq X platform was used for sequencing (Illumina). A previously described pipeline was used to align reads to nuclear chromosomes (hg19 assembly) and the mitochondrial genome (revised Cambridge Reference Sequence assembly, NC_012920.1) to identify deletions and duplications.9 We observed a chrM coverage depth of 106,170 for the patient (11,777,135 reads), whereas the controls were 54,426 and 101,942, respectively (6,092,978 and 11,263,816 reads). Gapped alignments, indicative of deletions/duplications, were clustered and visualized.9 Heteroplasmy levels for individual deletions/duplications were estimated by comparing the number of reads supporting the corresponding breakpoints to the total number of reads overlapping the breakpoints (including wild type) after removal of PCR duplicates.",0

"Molecular genetic analysis identifies POLG variants ES revealed that the patient had 2 potentially pathogenic heterozygous missense mutations in the gene coding for the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase gamma (POLG), the novel c.590T>C p.(F197S), and the previously described c.2740A>C; p.(T914P) (NM_002693.2) (ﬁgure 1, C and D).",1
"The variants were not common in the human population and aﬀected conserved amino acids among species (ﬁgure 1E). Genetic analysis of the sons revealed that both were heterozygous carriers for the c.2740A>C; p.(T914P) variant (ﬁgure 1C), demonstrating that the mutations are located on diﬀerent alleles. The F197S mutant has reduced 39-59 exonuclease activity",0
"To further understand the molecular consequences of the mutations, we expressed and puriﬁed WT, F197S, and T914P POLγA for biochemical analysis. We previously showed that T914P had no DNA binding aﬃnity.7 Given the patient’s relatively mild condition, we predicted the F197S mutation to have no impact on DNA binding aﬃnity, which we conﬁrmed using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (ﬁgure 2A). We next considered whether the Phe-197-Ser substitution aﬀected 39-59 exonuclease activity. F197 is strongly Figure 1 Morphologic analysis, pedigree, and molecular genetics",0

"conserved in the DNA polymerase A family across vertebrates and invertebrates (ﬁgure 2B, lower panel). In the 3959 exonuclease domain, the F197 residue is located within a large hydrophobic pocket where it forms numerous van der Waals interactions with the surrounding residues (ﬁgure 2B, upper panel). Substitution of the bulky and hydrophobic phenylalanine with the smaller and polar serine would likely cause partial collapse of this pocket and local structural distortions. This may induce a misalignment of the neighboring D198 residue and subsequent reduction in its ability to bind a catalytically essential Mg2+ ion. Of interest, the closely related T7 DNA polymerase carries a serine at this position (ﬁgure 2C, lower panel) arguing that this amino acid change might not provoke structural or functional changes. Structural analysis, however, revealed that the exonuclease pocket is substantially smaller and that the presence of a phenylalanine would induce severe steric clashes and likely destabilize the exonuclease domain in T7 DNA polymerase (ﬁgure 2C, upper panel).",0
"Despite being tolerated in T7 DNA polymerase, we decided to test whether the serine aﬀects the 39-59 exonuclease activity of POLγA in vitro. A double-stranded template with a one-nt 39-ﬂap (ﬁgure 2D, lower panel) was incubated with the WT or mutant POLγ variants including a previously characterized exonuclease-deﬁcient mutant D274A (herein EXO-) for comparison.11 As expected, WT POLγ was able to hydrolyze the primer (ﬁgure 2D, lanes 1–5), whereas EXOwas unable to degrade the primer (ﬁgure 2D, lanes 6–10). F197S was able to degrade the primer, however, to a much lower extent than WT. This demonstrates that in POLγA, unlike the related T7 DNA polymerases, a serine at this position is not well",0
"tolerated (ﬁgure 2D, lanes 16-20). No 39-59 exonuclease activity from T914P was observed (ﬁgure 2D, lanes 11–15), likely due to the lack of DNA binding rather than an enzymatic eﬀect of the mutation.7",0
"The exonuclease-deﬁcient POLγ (EXO-) in mice causes a 5-fold increase in mtDNA point mutations,12 prompting us to investigate the mutation load of the patient’s mtDNA. We isolated total muscle DNA from the patient and performed deep DNA sequencing. We identiﬁed a slight, but signiﬁcant, increase in mtDNA point mutations in the patient compared with age-matched controls (table), consistent with our in vitro ﬁndings. However, the level of heteroplasmy is likely too low to by itself explain the disease phenotype in the patient. The F197S mutation affects DNA polymerase activity",0
"We next tested the polymerase activities of the mutants. First, we performed a DNA synthesis assay using a circular singlestranded DNA (ssDNA) template (ﬁgure 3A, lower panel). Because the F197S mutation is located in the 39-59 exonuclease domain, we also included EXOfor comparison. We found that F197S was active as a polymerase, albeit with strongly diminished activity compared with WT and EXO- (ﬁgure 3A, lanes 16–20 vs 1–5 and 6–10, respectively). The speed of replication was slower, generating less full-length product due to increased stalling. T914P was unable to support DNA synthesis (ﬁgure 3A, lanes 11–15).7",0
"We also examined DNA synthesis in the context of the replisome (i.e., in the presence of the TWINKLE helicase and Figure 2 The F197S point mutation reduces 39-59 exonuclease activity",0
(A) The F197S mutant has WT-like DNA binding affinity. DNA affinity of POLγ to a primer template (lowerpanel) was examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Each reaction contained 10 fmol of DNA template and increasing (indicated) amounts of POLγ holoenzyme in a final volume of 15 μL. The reactions were run on 6% native polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 × TBE for 30 minutes at 180 V and visualized by autoradiography. No major differences in binding affinity between WT and F197S were observed. (B) The F197S point mutation disrupts the architecture of the exonuclease pocket. F197 is located in a large hydrophobic pocket directly adjacent to the catalytically essential D198 (upper panel; PDB ID: 3IKM). This residue is strongly conserved among members of the DNA polymerase A family (lower panel; Sc = Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Dm = Drosophila melanogaster; Xl = Xenopus laevis; Hs = Homo sapiens; Mm,0
"= Mus musculus). (C) The T7 exonuclease pocket is substantially smaller to accommodate a serine residue at the position equivalent to F197. Mutation of this residue to phenylalanine results in steric clashes, which would likely destabilize the pocket (PDB ID: 1T7P; Hs = Homo sapiens; T7 = bacteriophage T7). (D) A 59-labeled (32P) primer with a 39-mismatch was annealed to a circular single-stranded plasmid (lower panel to the left). POLγA with 39-59 exonuclease activity will, in the absence of dNTP, hydrolyze DNA into shorter fragments. As expected, WT degraded the primer (lanes 1–5), whereas EXOcould not due to lack of exonuclease activity (lanes 6–10). T914P showed no activity. The F197S mutant had weak exonuclease activity, only able to hydrolyze a few nucleotides under these conditions. The arrow indicates the partially hydrolyzed primer.",0

Here, F197S was able to synthesize long stretches of DNA, although it was not as eﬃcient as WT (ﬁgure 3B, compare lanes 11–15 and 1–5). T914P was not able to support DNA synthesis (ﬁgure 3A, lanes 11–15 and 3B lanes 6–10).7 To mimic the in vivo situation Table Somatic point mutations detected in mtDNA in the range between 1% and 5% heteroplasmy levels Heteroplasmy levels (%) Abbreviation: mtDNA = mitochondrial DNA. a Found in 1 of 10 controls.",0
"(of the patient), a reaction was included where both diseaseassociated mutants were mixed at a 1:1 ratio, but keeping the same total amount of protein. This decreased the eﬃciency of replication further due to only half the amount of POLγA (F197S) being functional (ﬁgure 3B, lanes 16–20 vs 11–15). The F197S mutant causes multiple deletions and duplications in vivo",0
"Disease-causing mutations in POLγ are known to cause mtDNA depletion and/or multiple mtDNA rearrangements. Based on the deep sequencing of isolated total muscle DNA, we found that mtDNA copy number in the patient was comparable to two controls, demonstrating that the patient does not exhibit mtDNA depletion (ﬁgure 4, A and C). However, the patient did have multiple deletions in both the major and minor arc (ﬁgure 4B). The sum heteroplasmy for the deletions and duplications amounted to 50.7%, which likely explains the patient’s phenotype (ﬁgure 4D). Of interest, we also found a strong hotspot region for duplications spanning over the promoter region (position 300 nt–1,000 nt) where the top 3 candidate duplications were closely spaced (positions: 310–962, 310–960, and 315–965) (ﬁgure",0
"4E) accounting for 21% heteroplasmy (14.7, 2.5, and 3.4% individually) of all deletions/duplications detected. Discussion We describe a patient with myopathy, PEO, and ptosis associated with biallelic POLG mutations. By identiﬁcation of mitochondrial myopathy caused by multiple large-scale mtDNA rearrangements and in vitro functional analysis of the identiﬁed POLG variants, we can explain several of the diﬀerent molecular events leading to the disease and thus functionally link the primary genetic defect to the clinical phenotype.",1
"POLG mutations are the most common cause of mitochondrial disease and are associated with a large variety of clinical phenotypes ranging from severe infantile neurodegenerative disorder with liver disease to late onset PEO with minor or no other symptoms.13 Our patient had a mild phenotype with ptosis and ophthalmoplegia as his main symptoms, requiring surgery for ptosis several years before his genetic diagnosis. His hearing deﬁcit was probably due to the POLG-associated mitochondrial disease because hearing loss is a characteristic ﬁnding in patients with PEO, especially autosomal dominant PEO. Whether the brain atrophy was part of the syndrome has not been deﬁnitely established, but brain atrophy has been found in 28% of patients with POLG-associated epilepsy.14",1
"Why some patients with mitochondrial disease develop PEO is not completely clear, partly because extraocular muscles are relatively inaccessible. However, MRI studies have demonstrated that extraocular muscles are atrophic in patients with PEO.15,16 The reason for this vulnerability has been speculated to depend on the distinct physiologic characteristics of extraocular muscles.17 They are very rich in mitochondria and are highly dependent on oxidative phosphorylation for endurance despite their composition of mainly fast-twitch ﬁbers, and they develop age-related mitochondrial changes with multiple deletions at a considerably higher rate than limb muscles. It is therefore likely that they accumulate multiple deletions secondary to POLγA dysfunction at a higher rate than limb muscles, which then leads to atrophy and muscle ﬁber loss.",0
"Our biochemical analysis of the mutant proteins showed that T914P had no activities, consistent with its previous characterization as an aggregation-prone inactive protein.7 The only potentially functional polymerase in the patient is thus Figure 3 The F197S mutation affects DNA polymerase activity",0

We found that F197S has reduced exonuclease and polymerase activities compared with WT POLγA, which can explain the patient phenotype.

"point mutations.18 F197S is uniquely located in motif I, adjacent to the D198 residue that is essential for 39-59 exonuclease activity.19 As expected from the location and strong conservation, F197S showed severely reduced 39-59 exonuclease activity. Nonetheless, this appears to be suﬃcient to deal with nucleotide misincorporation because only a very modest increase in mtDNA point mutations was observed in the patient.",0
We instead propose that the pathogenic molecular defect lies in reduced polymerase activity. That a mutation in the exonuclease domain can aﬀect polymerase activity is unexpected,0
"but not unprecedented20,21 and may be due to an imbalance between the polymerase and exonuclease activities. The ineﬃcient polymerase activity explains the patient’s disease phenotype and presence of mtDNA rearrangements. Recently, we were able to reconstitute mtDNA deletion formation in vitro and could demonstrate that replication stalling during L-strand synthesis causes copy-choice recombination and deletion formation.9 Most reported deletions in patients are found in the major arc of mtDNA, a ;11-kb region that becomes single-stranded during H-strand replication and acts as an ssDNA template during L-strand synthesis. The strong replication stalling by F197S on ssDNA can explain the mtDNA deletions identiﬁed in the patient.",0
"We also found mtDNA breakpoints consistent with duplications over the promoter region (mtDNA position 300–1,000 nt). Whether duplications themselves are pathogenic is not clear because no genetic material is lost. Exactly how these duplications arise is not known, but it would be interesting to investigate whether the G-rich conserved sequence block region causes extra problems for polymerases to bypass. It is intriguing to speculate that replication stalling, in combination with the high transcription activity in this area (both light and heavy strand promoters are located here), causes the duplications. In future, we will try to identify speciﬁc sequences that are hotspots for polymerase stalling to elucidate the formation of duplications/deletions further.",0
"More than 300 pathogenic POLG mutations have been reported, but the pathogenicity can be diﬃcult to establish. Here, we applied in vitro assays to investigate the functional properties of speciﬁc POLγ mutants, which in combination with clinical investigation and detailed analysis of mtDNA rearrangements by means of genome sequencing demonstrated not only pathogenicity but also deepens our understanding of the pathobiology. This approach will be essential in the future to evaluate novel POLG variants and already described variants that are not fully characterized with regard to pathogenicity.",0
