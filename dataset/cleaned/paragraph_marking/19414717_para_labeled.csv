"A 58-year-old woman presented to a neuroophthalmologist with a 5-year history of progressively blurred vision, diplopia, and longstanding bilateral ptosis. She described occasional choking episodes after eating as well as fatigue and shortness of breath after minimal exertion. Her older sibling had received corrective eyelid surgery for ptosis and two nieces had ptosis and proximal myopathy and were being investigated in another center. Direct and consensual pupillary light reflexes were normal with no rapid alternating pupillary defect.",1
Visual acuity was 20/20 on the right and 20/30 on the left. She had bilateral symmetric ptosis obscuring two-thirds of the pupil and restriction of eye movements below 60% of normal in all directions of gaze. Lower limb examination revealed symmetric proximal limb weakness (Medical Research Council grade 4+) with reduced reflexes and flexor plantars. Tandem gait was hesitant. Questions for consideration: What are the possible diagnoses? What initial investigations would you recommend? GO TO SECTION 2,1

"(A) Sequential cytochrome c oxidase (COX)/succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) histochemistry in the muscle biopsy from our patient reveals significant numbers (13%) of COX-deficient fibers, some of which show clear subsarcolemmal accumulation of abnormal mitochondria (marked with an asterisk). (B) Long-range PCR clearly demonstrates the presence of multiple mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions in patient muscle DNA (lane 4) compared to muscle DNA extracted from two agematched controls (lanes 1 and 2); lane 3 shows muscle DNA amplified from a patient with a single large-scale mtDNA deletion for comparison. M = size marker.",1
"SECTION 2 The initial differential diagnosis included Graves thyroid eye disease, a neuromuscular junction disorder (myasthenia gravis or botulism), oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, Miller Fisher variant of Guillain-Barre´ syndrome, and progressive muscular dystrophy.",0
"Free thyroxin and thyroid stimulating hormone levels were normal. Thyroid antibodies were negative. Acetylcholine receptor antibody assay was negative and repetitive nerve stimulation to exclude a neuromuscular junction disorder was normal. Electromyography of proximal upper limb muscles revealed an increased number of short duration motor units consistent with borderline myopathy. Nerve conduction velocities were normal, reducing the likelihood of an immunemediated inflammatory neuropathy.",1
"Due to the chronicity of symptoms, presence of gaze paresis, myopathic findings on neurophysiologic assessment, and family history of ocular complications suggestive of dominant inheritance, a muscle biopsy was performed. Polyadenylate binding- protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1) gene mutation analysis to exclude oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy was deferred pending muscle biopsy analysis.",1
"The muscle biopsy showed 13% cytochrome c oxidase (COX)– deficient fibers, significant numbers of ragged red fibers but no excess of lipid or glycogen accumulation, and subsarcolemmal accumulation of abnormal mitochondria suggestive of a mitochondrial cytopathy (figure 1A). Testing for common mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) point mutations (MELAS m.3243A>G [mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes], MERRF m.8344A>G [myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers], and NARP m.8993T>G/C [neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa]) did not reveal any abnormalities. Long-range PCR, however, revealed multiple mtDNA deletions in muscle (figure 1B).",1
