"Polymerase gamma (POLG, 174763) mutation leads to mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, resulting in epilepsy, movement disorders, cognitive impairment and liver dysfunction.1 Usually, clinical symptoms commence in early childhood, but later manifestation is also possible. Treatment options are limited and consist in symptomatic treatment. Beneficial effects of ketogenic diet were previously reported in six patients with POLG mutation.2-6 Ketogenic diet is based on high-fat and low carbohydrate intake. This induces a shift in cellular energy supply from glucose to ketones. In inborn disorders of",0

Here we present a case of POLG syndrome treated with anticonvulsants and ketogenic diet with initial good response, but nevertheless poor long-term outcome. | CASE REPORT",1
"A previously healthy 16-year-old female juvenile presented with migraine type headache. Within the outpatient visit, a secondary generalized seizure occurred. Cerebral MRI (cMRI) showed decreased diffusion on right occipital lobe; electroencephalography (EEG) presented focal slowing (Figure 1).

Therapy with lorazepam, levetiracetam, phenytoin, cortisone, valproate and lacosamid could not interrupt focal status epilepticus. Diagnostic work-up included lumbar puncture, which showed an isolated blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier",1
"dysfunction (leukocytes 3/μL [0-4/μL], protein 659 mg/L [150-450 mg/L] and albumin quotient 9.2 [<8]). In view of the clinical neurological symptoms, such as ascending tetraparesis, the suspicion of Guillain-Barre-syndrome raised and immunoglobulins IV were administered over 4 days without improvement.

"Six days after admission and because of typical pattern of epilepsia, presenting as epilepsia partialis continua, POLG molecular genetic testing was performed (Dr. J.A. Mayr, Salzburg) and revealed homozygous POLG mutation. A missense mutation in the encoding region and the adjoining introns leading to c.1399G>A (p.Ala467Thr) exchange was identified. Parents, both heterozygous carriers of this mutation, are healthy. This mutation has been previously described in patients with Alpers disease8,9 (# 203700). Though our",1

"patient received valproic acid (for 2 days) before diagnosis, no reparable liver dysfunction was noted.",0
"Immediately after diagnosis (day 9 after admission), in addition to antiseizure drugs, classical ketogenic diet (4:1) (KD) was started. Full ketosis (beta-hydroxybutyrate in plasma >2 mmoL/L) could be achieved after 5 days. Laboratory tests showed high levels of liver transaminases in blood with a normalization within 4 days (maximum aspartate transaminase 704 U/L, alanine transaminase 782 U/L, gamma glutamyltransferase 1700 U/L), blood glucose levels and pH were within normal range (glucose 74-110 mg/dL, pH 7.40-7.45). Repeated abdominal ultrasounds were normal.",1
"First control cMRI performed 2 days after onset of symptoms showed alternating areas of decreased diffusion (altogether eight MRIs were done). EEG abnormalities were persistent with focal slowing and superimposed epileptic spikes as typical for patients with POLG mutations (see Figure 1). Only treatment with midazolam and ketamine narcosis in combination with phenobarbital could stop the status epilepticus after 25 hours, though reduction of narcosis was only feasible after initiation of ketogenic diet (on fifth day of narcosis, see Figure 2). Her condition stabilized and she could be transferred to regular ward.",1
"Again 3 weeks later, she developed focal status epilepticus, despite ongoing therapy with levetiracetam, topiramate and phenytoin as well as ketogenic diet (4:1). Under treatment with thiopental narcosis for 5 days, seizures improved only short-term. When sedation was tempered, she showed focal seizures despite intensive antiepileptic therapy (levetiracetam, phenobarbital, midazolam, phenytoin, topiramate and cortisone), magnesium infusion, ketogenic diet and riboflavin, coenzyme Q10 and thiamine.",1
"Her condition worsened as she was severely encephalopathic and hardly able to communicate. She developed generalized myoclonus that did not correspond with an electroencephalographic change, and she had severe muscle pain. Ten weeks after admission, she was transferred to a hospice, and finally going home with mobile homenursing. The patient died 3 months after presenting with initial symptoms (Figure 2) from apnea. | LITERATURE REVIEW Only few reports exist on patients with POLG mutation and ketogenic diet (see Table 1).",1
"In 2009, Joshi et al described a 4.5-year-old girl with Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome and a heterozygous mutation in POLG1 gene (c.2243G>C; c.2480+1g>A).2 The girl presented with epilepsia partialis continua, after initiation",0
"of ketogenic diet (4:1) she remained seizure-free for 7 months. Triggered by an intercurrent infection under diet, she showed a subclinical status epilepticus, which could be successfully treated with midazolam infusion. After restart of the diet neither seizure control nor her baseline clinical state could be sustained anymore. At the age of 5.5 years, and 11 months after diagnosis, she died due to respiratory failure.2",0
"One year later (2010), Cardenas and Amato described a 14-month-old girl with compound heterozygous mutation in POLG1 gene (c.911T>G, c.1174C>g, pR1081dup) presenting with epilepsia partialis continua evolving into generalized status epilepticus. Treatment with a multidrug therapy, including ketogenic diet terminated her seizures, but she was severely encephalopathic. Several weeks after discharge seizures returned and she died at the age of 19 months, 5 months after diagnosis.3",0
"In 2011, Spiegler et al reported two patients diagnosed with Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome due to POLG1 mutation (patient 1 c.911T>G, c.3434insGAGG; patient 2 c.844T>G, c.1399G>A) at ages 33 and 45 months. Both were treated with ketogenic diet. The first patient did not respond and treatment was stopped 2 weeks after initiation, the boy died 3 months after diagnosis, at 35 months of age. The second patient became more alert and seizure activity ceased for a few weeks, but developed epilepsia partialis continua under treatment with antiepileptic drugs and KD, therapy was continued until death at 46 months.4 A 26-year-old woman with homozygous mutation in POLG1 gene (c.2243G>C) and non-convulsive status epilepticus was presented by Martikainen et al.5 Under low glycemic index treatment (LGIT), a variant of ketogenic diet, in addition to phenytoin, oxcarbazepine and levetiracetam, her symptoms resolved. Phenytoin and oxcarbazepine were gradually discontinued and she had no further seizures under levetiracetam monotherapy",0
"and LGIT.5 Another group described a boy diagnosed with Alpers syndrome and heterozygous POLG1 mutation (c.1399G>A; c.3562T>C) at the age of 9 months.6 After starting ketogenic diet at 13 months of age, seizures substantially decreased without clinical improvement. One month later and 5 months after diagnosis, he died due to congestive heart failure and respiratory difficulties.6 | DISCUSSION | Patients",0
"In our literature research, we found six patients with POLG mutation and intractable seizures receiving ketogenic diet2-5 (see Table 1). In five of these six patients, the diet led to substantial reduction of seizure activity, whereas general condition often did not improve.2-6 Four of these five died shortly after initiation of therapy2-4,6 (see Table 1). One reported patient did not respond, hence therapy was stopped after 2 weeks4 (see Table 1).",0
"In our patient, ketogenic diet only showed initial improvement of symptoms, with an improvement of EEG, finally leading to a reduction of antiseizure therapy and a stabilization of her general condition over a short time. However, she showed an outstanding rapid deterioration leading to death 3 months after initial presentation. | Ketogenic diet",0
"Ketogenic diet is used in inborn disorders of metabolism10,11 and is the treatment of choice in some of them; for example, glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome.12-14 Further, ketogenic diet was found to be effective for therapy of intractable seizures.11,15,16 However, the precise mechanism of action of the diet is not fully understood. As some inborn disorders of metabolism deteriorate with catabolism, ketosis should be reached and maintained without catabolism.",0
"According to data,1 most patients with POLG mutation presented with first symptoms in their early childhood. Our patient showed a juvenile and rapid progressive form of POLG mutation. The group of Martikainen presented a woman at the age of 26 years.5 Beside the adult patient, all patients died within 1 year after diagnosis. Thus, one might conclude that despite an initial improvement with ketogenic diet outcome is poor once symptoms have started. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS",0
