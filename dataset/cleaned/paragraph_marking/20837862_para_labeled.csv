Patient A 27-year-old man presenting with isolated distal myopathy of the upper extremities in the absence of sensory disturbances.,1
Results Histochemical analysis of a muscle biopsy specimen showed numerous cytochrome c oxidase–deficient fibers. Molecular analysis revealed marked depletion of muscle mitochondrial DNA in the absence of multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions. Sequence analysis of the POLG gene revealed heterozygous sequence variants in compound c.1156C>T (p.R386C) and c.2794C>T (p.H932Y) segregating with clinical disease in the family. The p.R386C change appears to be a novel mutation.,1
Conclusion Our case broadens the phenotypic spectrum of disorders associated with POLG mutations and highlights the complex relationship between genotype and phenotype in POLG-related disease.,0
"Mutations in the catalytic subunit of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymerase γ gene (POLG) are associated with a variety of disorders characterized by secondary defects of the mitochondrial genome and respiratory chain dysfunction.1 The phenotypic spectrum of POLG-related disease is extremely heterogeneous, ranging from late-onset progressive external ophthalmoplegia with multiple mtDNA deletions (OMIM 157640) to fatal infantile disorders, such as the Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome, usually associated with profound mtDNA depletion in affected tissues.2,3 Herein, we describe the unusual association of distal myopathy of the upper limbs and marked mtDNA depletion in skeletal muscle of an adult patient due to compound heterozygous mutations in POLG.",0
Report of a case Case,0
"A 27-year-old man born to nonconsanguineous parents presented with a 3-year history of progressive weakness of the distal upper limbs in the absence of sensory disturbances. He used to be an amateur tennis player but had to stop this activity on account of his reduced muscle strength. He reported normal motor development and there was no family history suggestive of neuromuscular disease. Clinical examination showed asymmetric, moderate weakness of wrist extension (Medical Research Council Scale score 3/5 on the right side and 4/5 on the left) and elbow flexion and finger extension (Medical Research Council Scale score 4/5). There was no muscle atrophy. Deep tendon reflexes were reduced in the upper extremities, corresponding with strength reduction. Muscle strength of the lower extremities was normal, and he had no evidence of ptosis or external ophthalmoplegia. His creatine kinase level was mildly increased (396 U/L; reference range, 22-269 U/L [to convert to microkatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167]), whereas his serum lactate level was normal (17.02 mg/dL; reference range, 4.5-20 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.111]). Radial, ulnar, and posterior tibialis nerve conduction studies were performed to rule out motor neuropathies and results were repeatedly normal. Electromyography consistently showed myopathic features characterized by early interference pattern and small polyphasic motor unit potentials in the biceps brachii, wrist extensors, and finger extensors bilaterally, although no electromyography abnormalities were observed in the trunk or lower limb muscles. Renal and hepatic profiles and thyroid, pancreatic, and cardiac function were all unremarkable. He subsequently underwent an open biopsy of the deltoid muscle for diagnostic purposes.",1

"Standard histological and histochemical analyses were performed on fresh frozen muscle sections (10 μm). Total DNA was extracted from blood and whole-muscle homogenates by standard procedures. Single cytochrome c oxidase (COX)–positive and COX-deficient skeletal muscle cells were separately obtained by laser-capturing microdissection with the MMI UV-CUT System (Nikon Instruments, Kingston, England).4 The total amount of mtDNA was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, as previously described.5 Briefly, an mtDNA fragment (nucleotide 4625-4714) and a nuclear DNA fragment (FasL gene) were coamplified using a multiplex TaqMan polymerase chain reaction assay (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Parsley, England). For each assay, a standard curve for mtDNA and nuclear DNA was generated using serial dilutions of a vector (kind gift from Andrea Cossarizza, MD, PhD) in which the regions used as the template for the 2 amplifications were cloned tail to tail to have a ratio of 1:1 of the reference molecules. The absolute mtDNA copy number per nucleus was obtained by multiplying the ratio of mtDNA to nuclear DNA values by 2 (because 2 copies of the nuclear gene are present in a cell). Screening for mtDNA large-scale rearrangements was carried out by real-time polymerase chain reaction6 and conventional polymerase chain reaction using shifted primer sets within the major arc of human mtDNA7 both on muscle homogenate DNA and on microdissected cells. The entire coding region and intron-exon boundaries of POLG were amplified and directly sequenced as previously reported.1",0
