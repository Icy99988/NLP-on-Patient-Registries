PEO caused by mutation in the POLG gene is associated with more severe phenotypes than those forms caused by mutation in the adenine nucleotide translocator 1 (ANT1) gene [PEO with mtDNA deletions, autosomal dominant 2 (PEOA2)] or C10ORF2 gene (PEOA3) [5]. Mutations in nDNA that affect mitochondria are very diverse and even include mtDNA defects (which are responsible for maintenance, replication, and translation). nDNA mutations can lead to apoptosis, changes in mitochondrial metabolism or mitochondrial chaperones damage [1]. POLG gene sequencing in patients with mitochondrial disease with PEO is helpful for a diagnosis confirmation.
